<p>Layers let you organize your work into distinct levels that can be edited and viewed as individual units. Every Inkscape
document contains at least one layer. Creating multiple layers in your artwork lets you easily control how artwork
is printed, displayed, and edited.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll finish the artwork of a wall clock as you explore the various ways to use the Layers palette. Before you begin, you will open the finished art file for this lesson to see what you'll create. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Start Inkscape.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/Tutorial06End.svg"><b>Tutorial06End.svg</b></a> file in the Lesson06 folder, located inside the
    Lessons folder within the AICIB folder on your hard drive.<br>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/Tutorial06FinishedImage.gif"

    </li>
    <li>If you like, you may leave the file open as a visual reference. Do this by reducing the
    size of your window, then select View &gt; Fit in Window. If you don't want to leave the image open,
    choose File &gt; Close.<br><br>

    <aside>Tip: For an illustration of the finished artwork in this lesson, see the illustration
    at the very beginning of this lesson.
    </aside>

    <br>To begin working, you'll open an existing file.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/Tutorial06Start.svg"><b>Tutorial06Start.svg</b></a> file in the Tutorial06 folder.<br>

    <li>Choose File &gt; Save As, name the file <b>Clock.svg</b>, and select the Tutorial06 folder.
    </li>
</ol>
<aside>
<p>Using the Layers palette, you can create multiple levels of artwork that reside on separate, overlapping layers,
sublayers, and groups in the same file. Layers act like individual, clear sheets containing one or more objects.
Where no filled (or nontransparent) objects overlap, you can see through any layer to the layer below.</p>

<p>You can create and edit objects on any layer without affecting the artwork on any other layer.
You can also display, print, lock, and reorder layers as distinct units.</p>

<header><h2>Creating Layers</h2>
</header>
<p>Every document in Inkscape contains one layer by default. You can rename the layer and add more layers
at any time as you create the artwork. Placing objects on separate layers lets you easily select and edit
them by their organization. For example, by placing type on a separate layer, you can change the type all
at once without affecting the rest of the artwork.</p>

<p>You'll change the layer name to "Clock," and then you'll create another layer.</p>

<ol>
    <li>If the Layers palette isn't visible on-screen, choose Layer &gt; Layers to display it. Alternatively,
    you can click on the <b>View Layers</b> icon (<img src = "images/ViewLayers.gif" alt = "View Layers icon" >) in the Commands Bar.<br><br>
    Layer 1 (the default name for the first layer) is highlighted, indicating that it is active.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/LayersDialogBox.gif" alt = "Layers Dialog Box"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Layer 1 is highlighted</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>In the Layers palette, double-click the layer name to highlight it. Type
    <b>Clock</b> in the text box, and then press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the new name.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/DoubleClickLayer1.gif"
        alt = "Double-click Layer 1 to highlight it."
        class = "img-fluid">

    </figure>
    Now you'll create a sublayer for the clock numbers.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Layer &gt; Add Layer... You can also right-click on the <b>Clock</b> layer bar in the Layers palette. The
    Layers short-cut menu appears.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on <b>Add Layer...</b> The Add Layer Dialog box appears. The <b>Layer name</b> is <b>Clock 1</b>.
    It is highlighted, which means that you can edit it. Change the <b>Layer name</b> to <b>Numbers</b>.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the down selector arrow (<img src = "images/DownArrow.gif" alt = "Selection list arrow" >) in the <b>Position</b> selection box and select <b>As sublayer of current</b> (as a

<h2>Moving Objects and Layers</h2>
</header>
<p>By rearranging the layers in the <b>Layers</b> palette, you can reorder layered objects in your artwork.
You can also move selected objects from one layer or sublayer to another.</p>

<p>First, you'll move the clock numbers onto their own sublayer.</p>

<ol>
    <li>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" >),
    click on the numeral <b>1</b> on the clock face to select it.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Select1.gif" alt = "Select the numeral 1."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Select the numeral <b>1</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Layer &gt; Move Selection to Layer Below. The <b>Numbers</b> layer bar in the <b>Layers</b> palette
    is highlighted, indicating that it is now the active layer and that the numeral <b>1</b> is now located on
    the <b>Numbers</b> layer.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/NumbersSublayerHighlighted.gif"
        alt = "Numeral 2 moved to Numbers sublayer."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Move the numeral <b>2</b> to the <b>Numbers</b> sublayer.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the numeral <b>2</b> on the clock face. The numeral <b>2</b> is now selected and the <b>Clock</b> layer
    is highlighted, indicating that you have moved off the <b>Numbers</b> layer and onto the <b>Clock</b> layer,
    where numeral <b>2</b> is actually located.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectNumeral2.gif"
        alt = "Select the numeral 2."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Select the numeral <b>2</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Again, choose Layer &gt; Move Selection to Layer Below. The <b>Numbers</b> layer bar in the Layers palette
    is highlighted again. The numeral <b>2</b> is now on the <b>Numbers</b> layer.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Select numeral <b>3</b>, but this time, press the hot-key combination &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; to
    make the <b>Numbers</b> layer active and add the <b>3</b> onto this layer. Repeat this step for numbers <b>4</b>,
    <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>For numerals <b>7</b> through <b>12</b>, move them to the <b>Numbers</b> layer <u>as a group</u> by
    &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on them (see Tutorial 2, Using the Select Tool), and then pressing
    &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt;.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/ShiftClickOn7To12.gif"
        alt = "Select numerals 7 to 12."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Select numerals <b>7</b> to <b>12</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Edit &gt; Deselect. Then choose File &gt; Save.<br><br>
    Now you'll move the face of the clock to a new layer to use later when you add the stripes, hands,
    and brand name of the clock, and you'll rename the <b>Clock</b> layer to reflect the new organization
    of the artwork.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Clock</b> layer bar to highlight it. Then click on the boxed minus sign (<img src =
    "images/BoxedMinusSign.gif" alt = "Boxed minus sign" >)to collapse
    the <b>Numbers</b> layer bar underneath. This will help simplify your work. We will add the new layer
    above <b>Clock</b>.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/HighlightClockLayerBar.gif"
        alt = "Highlight the Clock layer bar."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Click on the <b>Clock</b> layer bar to highlight it.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/CollapsedNumbersLayerBar.gif"
        alt = "Collapse the Numbers layer bar."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Collapse the <b>Numbers</b> layer bar.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    Note how the boxed plus sign becomes a boxed plus sign, indicating that the <b>Clock</b> layer
    contains a sublayer which becomes visible when you click on the plus sign.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Add a new layer by clicking on the plus sign icon (<img src = "images/PlusSignIcon.gif" alt = "Plus sign icon" >) on the bottom left of the <b>Layers</b> palette. Label the new layer <b>Face</b>.
<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/NewLayer2.gif"
        alt = "Create a new layer."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Create a new layer by clicking on the plus sign icon.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/Face.gif"
        alt = "Label the new layer Face."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Label the new layer <b>Face</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Add</b> button. The <b>Face</b> layer is added above the <b>Clock</b> layer and becomes
    active.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/FaceAboveClock.gif"
        alt = "The new layer Face is added above the Clock layer."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The new layer <b>Face</b> is added above the <b>Clock</b> layer.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>In the artwork, click behind the numbers to select the clock face. Notice that the <b>Clock</b>
    layer bar is highlighted, signaling that it is now the active layer.<br>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/SelectFace.gif"
            alt = "Select the clock face."
            class = "img-fluid">
            <figcaption>Select the clock face.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; to make the <b>Face</b> layer active and have it contain the clock's
    face.<br>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/ClockFaceInFaceLayer.gif"
            alt = "Clock face is now in the Face layer."
            class = "img-fluid">
            <figcaption>The <b>Face</b> layer now contains the clock face object.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Deselect the clock face by clicking anywhere off the face.<br><br>
    What we have done now is put the clock face over the numbers so we can't see them.
    It is as if we pulled a sheet of tracing paper with the face circle drawn on it out of a stack of
    tracing paper sheets, each sheet having a drawing of the clock frame, clock face,
    and numbers, and put the face drawing on the very top of the stack, covering up the numbers.<br><br>
    We will now relocate the numbers so that they are on top of the clock face.<br><br>
    </li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Moving a Sublayer</h2>
<p>The numbers for the hours are covered over now by the image of the clock face. The clock face is topmost in the
stack of layers that make up the artwork. The numbers that represent the hours are on the <b>Numbers</b> sublayer. This
sublayer is subordinate to the <b>Clock</b> layer.</p>
    <figure style = "float: left; margin-right: 0;">
        <img src = "images/Layers.gif" alt = "Layer decomposition."

    You will see the <b>Move Indicator</b> (<img src = "images/MoveIndicator.png" alt = "Move Indicator" >) as you drag the bar.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Release the mouse button. The <b>Numbers</b> bar settles into place above the <b>Face</b> layer bar and
    the numbers appear on the artwork on the clock face.<br>

    <li>Double-click the <b>Clock</b> layer to highlight the layer name. Change the layer name to <b>Frame</b>
    and press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the name.

<h2>Locking Layers</h2>
<p>As you edit objects on a layer, use the <b>Layers</b> palette to lock other layers and prevent selecting
or changing the rest of the artwork.</p>
<p>Now you'll lock all the layers except the <b>Numbers</b> layer so that you can easily edit the clock
numbers without affecting objects on other layers. Locked layers cannot be selected or edited in any way.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click on the open padlock icon (<img src = "images/OpenPadlockIcon.gif" alt = "Open Padlock icon" >) in the <b>Face</b> and <b>Frame</b> layer bars to lock them. The closed padlock icon
    (<img src = "images/ClosedPadlockIcon.gif" alt = "Closed Padlock icon" class = "center">) indicates that
    a layer is locked. You cannot select it or make any changes to it.<br>

    </figure>
    <p>Now you'll change the type size and font of the numbers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Press the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-A (case-insensitive) hot key pair to select all the numbers on the clock face.
    Notice that only the numbers are selected. The clock face and frame are unaffected because they are
    in layers that have been locked.<br>

    <li>Click on the <b>Text and Font</b> icon (<img src = "images/TextAndFontIcon.gif"
		alt = "Text and Font icon" >) in the Commands menu bar. The <b>Text and Font</b> palette appears. Select the <b>Font</b>
    tab if it isn't selected already. Select another font or size for the group of numbers.
    (We used Myriad Pro Bold, size 28 points.)<br><br>
    <aside>
    <b>Note:</b> Myriad Pro is an OpenType font that I included in the Tutorial 6 folder. If it is not installed
    on your computer and you want to use it, download and install it (<a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/MyriadPro-Bold.otf"

<p>The <b>Layers</b> palette lets you hide layers, sublayers, or individual objects from view.
When a layer is hidden, objects on that layer are also locked and cannot be selected or printed.
You can also use the <b>Layers</b> palette to display layers or objects in <b>Outline</b> mode, <b>Grayscale</b>
mode, or <b>No Filters</b> mode to view independently from other layers in the artwork.</p>

<p>Now you'll edit the frame on the clock, using gradient-painting techniques to create a three-dimensional
effect on the frame.</p>

<p>You will start by creating sublayers to the <b>Frame</b> layer that will contain individual parts of
the frame that you can modify without affecting other neighboring parts.

    Your result should be similar to the figure above. The bronze ring that make up the second outer circle isn't
    there. It turns out that it is, but it's covered over the <b>Outer Lower Frame</b> circle. The bottommost two
    sublayers are in opposite order. You will now move the <b>Outer <u>Upper</u> Frame</b> layer above the <b>Outer

    <li>The Select cursor turns into a <b>Gradient control</b> cursor (<img src = "images/GradientControlCursor.gif" alt = "Gradient Control cursor" >). Drag the square end of the line to the bottom of the circle.
    Drag the circular end to the top to change the direction of the gradient from horizontal to vertical.<br><br>

    <aside><b>Note:</b> The <b>Gradient control line</b> which guides the direction the gradient takes
    has a circle at one end and a square at the other. When you hover the cursor over one end, its color changes to
    red. When you select an end, its color changes to blue, indicating that it is the active end of the
    control line. They are white when deselected.<br><br>
    The <b>Gradient Control</b> tool works only on selected objects that are filled with gradients.

<h2>Pasting Layers</h2>
<p>To complete the clock, you'll copy and paste the finishing parts of artwork from another file.
You can paste layered files into another file and keep all the layers intact.</p>

    <li>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the
	<a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/Details.svg"><b>Details.svg</b></a> file, located in the Tutorial 06 folder.<br><br>
    The font for the brand might look different on your computer than what you see in the example below. The font is
    called <b>Ametist</b>. If this font is not installed on your computer and you want to use it, you can download it
    here (<a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial06/Ametist.ttf" title = "Click here to access the Ametist font"><b>Ametist</b></a>) from the Tutorial06 folder and install it.

<h2>Creating Clipping Masks</h2>
<p>The Layers palette lets you create clipping masks to control how artwork on a layer (or in a group)
is hidden or revealed. A clipping mask is an object or group of objects whose shape masks artwork below
it so that only artwork within the shape is visible.</p>

<p>Now you'll create a clipping mask with the circle shape in the <b>Face</b> layer. You'll group it with
the <b>Stripes</b> layer so that only the stripes show through the circle shape.</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the <b>Layers</b> palette, drag the <b>Stripes</b> layer so that it is located immediately
    underneath the <b>Face</b> layer. If the <b>Stripes</b> layer ends up as a sublayer to the <b>Face</b>
    layer, that is absolutely fine. The important thing is that the <b>Face</b> be immediately above
    the <b>Stripes</b> layer.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/StripesUnderneathFace.gif"
        alt = "Stripes layer placed underneath Face layer"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The <b>Stripes</b> layer has been put underneath the <b>Face</b> layer
        (here, as a sublayer to <b>Face</b>).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    A masking object must reside <u>above</u> the objects it will mask in the <b>Layers</b> palette. Since you
    want to mask only the stripes, you'll move the circular <b>Face</b> object to above the <b>Stripes</b>
    layer before you create the clipping mask.
    </li>
    <li>In the <b>Layers</b> palette, right-click on the <b>Face</b> layer and choose <b>Lock/Unlock Other layers</b>
    in the short-cut menu. All layers other than <b>Face</b> are now locked. Unlock the <b>Stripes</b> layer
    by clicking on its <b>Show/hide</b> icon.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/FaceStripesUnlocked.gif"
        alt = "Face and Stripes layers are unlocked."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The <b>Face</b> and <b>Stripes</b> layers are unlocked. All other layers are locked.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Both the masking object above and object to be masked below must be selected in order for clipping to happen.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" >),
    marquee select the <b>Stripes</b> object and the <b>Face</b> object in the artwork. (See Tutorial 2,
    Marquee Select, for review.)<br>

<h2>Applying Appearance Attributes to Layers</h2>
<p>You can apply appearance attributes such as styles, effects, and transparency to layers, groups,
and objects with the <b>Layers</b> palette. When an appearance attribute is applied to a layer, any object
on that layer will take on that attribute. If an appearance attribute is applied only to a specific
object on a layer, it affects only that object, not the entire layer.</p>

<p>You will apply an effect to an object on a layer. Then you'll copy that effect to a layer to change
all objects on that layer.</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the <b>Layers</b> palette, collapse the <b>Face</b> layer and expand the <b>Frame</b> layer
    to reveal all its objects.
    </li>
	<li>Right-click on any layer bar and choose <b>Lock all layers</b>. Then, unlock the <b>Frame</b>
    layer and <b>Outer Lower Frame</b> sublayer. You will apply an effect to the <b>Outer Lower Frame</b> sublayer.
    <br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/CollapseFaceExpandFrame.gif"
        alt = "Collapse the Face layer and expand the Frame layer."

    </li>
    <li>Select the bottom path in the <b>Frame</b> layer (<b>Outer Lower Frame</b>) and then
    click on the artwork to select the bottommost circle in the artwork.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectArtwork.gif" alt = "Select artwork."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Click on the artwork to select the bottommost circle.</figcaption>

    </li>
    <li>Choose Filters &gt; Shadows and Glows &gt; Drop Shadow...<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>The <b>Drop Shadow</b> dialog box appears. Choose:
        <ul style = "list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><b>Blur radius (px): 5.0</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Horizontal offset (px): 5.0</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Vertical offset (px): 5.0</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Shadow type: Outer</b>
            </li>
            <li>check the <b>Live preview</b> checkbox so you can see the immediate effect of the drop shadow.
        </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/DropShadow1.gif" alt = "Drop shadow"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Drop shadow.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <aside><b>Note:</b> Inkscape has a problem when multiple objects are visible and you want to create a
    drop shadow. Other shadows might appear that you don't want and might compromise the quality of your
    artwork. This problem can be resolved easily. Check each layer and sublayer one-by-one for the type
    of color blending present for each layer. Check the <b>Blend mode</b> feature to see whether its
    setting is <b>Normal</b>. If not, then change the blend setting to <b>Normal</b>. If the drop shadow
    persists, then continue to check other layers and change their blend mode setting to <b>Normal</b>.
    </aside>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>The problem has been found in sublayer <b>Inner Frame copy</b> The blend setting is <b>Screen</b>
    which mixes colors in different layers in a way that makes them darker.<br>

    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>From the <b>Blend mode</b> drop-down list, choose <b>Normal</b>. The second shadow disappears,
    you have just fixed the problem. Note, however, that the light portion of the gradient in the inner
    band of the frame is a little darker. That change is a small price to pay for eliminating a glaring
    and possibly uncomfortable problem.<br>

    </li>
    <li>You will now add drop shadows to the clock hands and numbers. You will group the hands and numbers and
    copy them into their own layer and use the blur feature to make shadows out of them, and reposition them all
    as a group.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Rename the <b>Details</b> layer by double-clicking on the name and typing <b>Drop Shadows</b>. Press
    &lt;Enter&gt; to set the name. This layer should already be located below the <b>Numbers</b> and
    <b>Hands</b> layers. This position indicates that the drop shadow objects are indeed located underneath
    the artwork's original numbers and hands, giving an illusion of depth.<br><br>

	</ol>

    <p>You have completed building a layered file.</p>
    <p>In some cases after the artwork is complete, you may want to place all the layers of art onto
    a single layer and delete the empty layers. This is called flattening artwork. Delivering finished
    artwork in a single layer file can prevent accidents, such as hiding layers, and not printing parts
    of the artwork, from happening.</p>

    <aside>
    <h2>Merging and Flattening Artwork</h2>
    <p>Merging and flattening are similar in that they let you consolidate paths, groups, and sublayers.
    With merging, you can select which items you want to consolidate, with flattening, all visible
    items in the artwork are consolidated in a single, parent layer. With either option, the stacking
    order of the artwork remains the same.</p>

    <h3>To Merge Artwork into a Single Layer or Group:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Unlock just those layers that contain items you want to merge into one layer. It is wise to have
        a new receptacle layer already created to put the selected items into.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Select the items that you want to merge in the <b>Layers</b> palette.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Marquee select your artwork and group (choose Object &gt; Group) the items that are selected
        from the marquee select.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; or &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; to make the destination layer
        active. At this point, the selected items are located in the destination layer.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Choose Edit &gt; Deselect or click off the selected artwork to deselect it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Flatten Artwork:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that all the layers you want to flatten are visible.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Select the layer into which you will flatten the artwork or create a new destination layer.
        You cannot flatten artwork into hidden, locked, or template layers. They won't accept incoming
        items. Regardless of the layer you select, the options for the layer and the stacking order of
        the artwork don't change.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Marquee select your artwork and group the items (choose Object &gt; Group) that are selected
        from the marquee select into one object.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; or &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; to make the destination layer
        active. At this point, all the items in the selected layers are located in the destination layer.
        It might be wise to delete the original source layers. Test each source layer against the flattened
        layer to verify that you do indeed have a copy of the original in the destination layer. If you find a
        discrepancy between source and destination layers, either choose Edit &gt; Undo or use the hot-key
        combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z (case insensitive) to undo your most recent action or actions to help you
		troubleshoot. If you find an error, you will be in a good position to resolve the graphics design
		error and maintain the integrity of your artwork.<br><br>

<h2>Review answers</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Benefits of using layers when creating artwork include: You can protect artwork that you don't
    want to change, you can hide artwork that you aren't working with so that it's not distracting,
    and you can control what prints.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>To hide a layer, you click the eye icon The <b>Open Eye</b>
    icons (<img src = "images/OpenEyeIcon.gif" alt = "Open Eye icon" >) to the left
    of the layer name. To redisplay a layer, click the <b>Closed Eye</b> icon (<img src = "images/ClosedEyeIcon.gif"
    alt = "Closed Eye icon" class = "center">) to the left of the layer name.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>You reorder layers by selecting a layer name in the <b>Layers</b> palette and dragging the layer
    to its new location. You can also click on a layer to be moved to select it, and then click on the Up Arrow
    (<img src = "images/RaiseLayerBarArrow.gif" alt = "Raise Layer Bar Arrow" >) or Down Arrow
    (<img src = "images/LowerLayerBarArrow.gif" alt = "Lower Layer Bar Arrow" >) at the bottom
    of the <b>Layers</b> palette to move that layer up or down in the layer order. The order of layers in
    the <b>Layers</b> palette controls the document's layer order &ndash; topmost in the palette is frontmost
    in the artwork.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>You can lock layers in a few different ways:<br><br>
        <ul style = "list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>You can choose Lock All Layers from the <b>Layers</b> palette menu to lock all layers.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>You can choose Lock Others from the <b>Layers</b> palette menu to lock all layers but
            the active layer.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>You can hide a layer to protect it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Select the object you want to move. Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt; or &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt;
    to highlight the layer bar of the destination layer.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Create a clipping mask on a layer by selecting the layer and then choosing Object &gt; Clip &gt; Set.
    The topmost object in the layer will become the clipping mask.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Select the layer bar of the layer to which you want to apply an effect. Make sure that the layer is
    visible (<img src = "images/OpenEyeIcon.gif" alt = "Open Eye icon" >) and unlocked
    (<img src = "images/OpenPadlockIcon.gif" alt = "Open Padlock icon" >) so you can edit it.
    Select all objects in the layer (you might need to do a marquee select) and then apply the desired effect.
