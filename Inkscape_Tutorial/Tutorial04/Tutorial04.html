  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
</header>
<p>The first part of this lesson involves manipulating the Pen tool on a blank artboard.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Inkscape if it isn't started already.</li>
  <li>Open the file named <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/Tutorial04Image01.svg"><b>Tutorial04Image01.svg</b></a> file in the Tutorial04 folder. The top portion of the artboard shows the path that you will create. Use the bottom half of the page for this exercise.
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/Tutorial04Image01.png"
      alt = "Image file 1 for Tutorial 4" width = "300"
      class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li>Choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Drawing to fit the page into the window and then close the palette by choosing View &gt; Show/Hide, and clicking on Palette. You won't need to use it for this lesson.
  </li>
  <li><p>Select the Pen tool icon in the toolbox (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Pen tool"
  width = "26" >). A Tool Controls bar appears at the top of the window dedicated to
  enhancing your ability to control the Pen tool.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src = "images/PenToolControlBar.png" alt = "Pen tool controls bar"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Pen Tool Controls Bar.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li>Click on the Create a Sequence of Straight Line Segments icon (<img src = "images/StraightLinesIcon.gif"
  alt = "Draw straight lines icon" >) in the Pen tool control bar.</li>

  <li>Click and release once near the top of the page. The Pen tool creates a square anchor point.
  Then, move the mouse away from the original anchor point. See how the line is drawn from the
  cross at the tip of the pen.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/PenToolWithCross.gif" alt = "Pen tool with cross"
        class = "img-fluid" >
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Move the mouse to the right and click once to create the next anchor point in the path.</p>

<p><i><b>Note:</b> The first segment you draw will not be set until you click a second anchor point. Also, if direction handles appear, you've accidentally dragged with the Pen tool; release the mouse left button, press &lt;Delete&gt;, click on the Pen tool straight lines icon to make sure it is active (<img src = "images/StraightLinesActiveIcon.gif" alt = "Pen control tool active" > and click again in the work area. (Direction handles are used to reshape curved paths, but do not print.)</i></p>

<p>The first point connects to the new anchor point. Click back under the initial anchor point to create a zigzag pattern. Click and release from point to point to create the zigzag. Your zigzag is complete when it has
a total of six anchor points.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag1.gif" alt = "Zigzag path, last path not set"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Zigzag path, last path not set</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag2.gif" alt = "Zigzag path, last path set"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Left-click to set last path</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
       <img src = "images/Zigzag3.gif" alt = "Zigzag path, finalized paths"
       class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Right-click or press &lt;Enter&gt;<br>to finalize the path</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" >). One of the many benefits of using the Pen tool is that you can create custom paths and edit the anchor points that make up the path. You can learn more about the selection tools by reviewing Tutorial 2, "Selection Basics"; here you will see how the selection tools relate to the Pen tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Using the Select tool, click on the zigzag path and see how the zigzag is enclosed in a
bounding box, signifying that all line segments and anchor points are selected.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectedZigzag.gif" alt = "Selected Zigzag path"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Zigzag path selected</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Left-click and drag the path to a new location anywhere on the artboard. Notice that all the line
segments and anchor points travel together, maintaining the zigzag path.</p>
</li>
<li>
Deselect the zigzag path any one of these three ways:
    <ol type = "a">
        <li>Use the Select tool and click on an empty section of the artboard.</li>
        <li>Use Edit > Deselect from the menu.</li>
        <li>Click once on the Pen tool icon in the Toolbar. Even though it looks like the
        path is still active, it will not connect to the next anchor point created.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Here is an optional way of creating a new path separate from the one you have just
    created: you can click on the Pen tool again after you have finalized (that is, right-clicked or
    pressed &lt;Enter&gt;) you last composite path. Even though it looks like the path is
    still active, it will not connect to the next anchor point created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the <b>Edit paths by nodes</b> tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >). Note that a new Tools Control bar appears dedicated to the Edit path tool.</p>
<figure>
    <img src = "images/EditNodesToolControlBar.gif"
    alt = "Edit paths by nodes tools control bar"
    class = "img-fluid" >
    <figcaption>Edit paths by nodes tools control bar (full bar)</figcaption>
</figure>
    <p>Each icon represents a specific function.</p>

    alt = "Edit paths by nodes tools control bar left half"
    class = "img-fluid">

    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Right half of the Edit paths by nodes control bar</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We'll use several Edit Paths by Nodes tools in this tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>Click on any one point in the zigzag. Using the marquee selection technique with the Edit Paths by Nodes tool, or <b>Node tool</b> for short, can make selecting individual anchor points easier. The selected anchor point turns red, while the rest remain grey.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag4.gif"
        alt = "Using the Node tool to select a single anchor point"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting a single anchor point with the Node tool.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p><b>Note:</b> the red selected anchor point turns blue when you take the Node cursor off, indicating
that the point is still selected.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag5.gif"
        alt = "Cursor taken off selected anchor point"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>A blue anchor point means that it is still selected.</figcaption>
    </figure>

</li>
<li>
With the anchor point selected, click and drag. The anchor point is moving but the others are stationary. This is how you edit a path.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag6.gif"
        alt = "Using the Node tool to edit a single anchor point"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Dragging a single anchor point to the right with the Node tool.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</li>
<li>At times, you will need to recreate just one line segment in a path. Click on the Node tool
(<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >),
and click on any line segment with the Node tool cursor.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag7.gif"
        alt = "Using the Node tool to edit a single path"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Select a path on click on with the Node tool.</figcaption>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Click on the path with the Node tool.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Note how the two anchor points for that segment turn blue, indicating that you have selected
that part of the path.
</li>
<li>Click on the Delete Segment Between Two Non-Endpoint Nodes icon
(<img src = "images/DeleteSegmentBetween2NonEndpointNodes.gif" alt = "Delete Segment Between Two
Non-Endpoint Nodes" width = "26" >) in the Tools Control Bar. The selected line
segment disappears.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag9.gif"
        alt = "Line segment is now deleted"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Line segment is deleted.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</li>
<li>
Now choose Edit &gt; Deselect to deselect the two separate paths.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag13.gif" alt = "Two separate paths"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Two separate paths.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</li>
<li>
We will now reconnect the two paths.  Click on the Node tool and then click on one of the
anchor points of the deleted line segment to select it. The anchor point turns red.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag10.gif" alt = "Click on a first anchor point"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Clicking on a first anchor point.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</li>
<li>Now &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the second anchor point. Note how the anchor points change color.
The first (blue) anchor point stays selected because you &lt;Shift&gt;-clicked on the second (red) point.
If you just clicked on the second anchor point without pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key at the same time,
you would have deselected the first point. It would have reverted to its original grey color.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Zigzag11.gif"
        alt = "Shift-clicking on the second anchor point"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>&lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the second anchor point.</figcaption>
    </figure>

</li>
<li>With both anchor points selected, click on the Join Selected Endnodes with a New Segment icon
(<img src = "images/JoinSelectedNodesWithANewSegment.gif"
alt = "Join selected endnodes with a new segment icon" width = "26" >)
in the Tools Control Bar. There is now a new line segment connected the selected anchor points.

<header><h2>Creating Straight Lines</h2></header>
<p>In Tutorial 3, you discovered that using the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key in combination with shape tools constrains the shape of objects you create using Inkscape. This is also true with the Pen tool, except that using the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key constrains the paths you create to angles that are multiples of 15&deg;.</p>

<p>In this part of the lesson, you will learn how to draw straight lines.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the file named <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/Tutorial04Image02.svg"><b>Tutorial04Image02.svg</b></a> from the Tutorial04 folder. The top portion of the artboard shows the path that you will create. Use the bottom half of the page for this exercise.</p>

<img src = "images/Tutorial04Image02.png"
alt = "Image 2 for Inkscape Tutorial 4" width = "400"
class = "img-fluid">
</li>
<li><p>Select the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Pen tool" >), then choose
the Create a sequence of straight line segments icon (<img src = "images/StraightLinesIcon.gif"
  alt = "Draw straight lines icon" >) in the Tool Controls bar. Click once in the
  work area of the page.</p>
</li>
<li>Hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key down and click about an inch to the right of the original anchor point.
</li>
<li><p>While holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, click and drag with the mouse and try to replicate
the path in the exercise file.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/ConstrainedPath.gif" alt = "Constrained path"

	<p>The first horizontal line segment is where it's supposed to be. It is just hidden underneath
	the dashed bounding box.</p>
</li>
<li>File &gt; Save and close the file.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<header><h2>Creating Curved Paths</h2></header>
<p>In this part of the lesson, you'll learn how to draw smooth, curved lines with the Pen tool. In vector-drawing programs such as Inkscape, you can draw a curve, called a B&eacute;zier curve, using control points. By setting anchor points and dragging direction handles (controls), you can define the shape of the curve. Although drawing curves this way takes some getting used to, it gives you the greatest control and flexibility in creating paths.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Before we get started with a lesson file, choose File > New to create a new document in Inkscape. Click on the Zoom In or Out icon in the toolbox (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom In or Out icon" width = "26" >) and then click on the Zoom to Fit Page in Window icon in the toolbar that appears when you click on the Zoom In or Out icon (<img src = "images/ZoomToFit.gif" alt = "Zoom to fit icon" width = "26" >). Consider this page a "scratch" page to practice the B&eacute;zier curve.</li>

    <li><p>Click on the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Pen tool" width = "26" >) in the toolbar, and then on the Create Regular B&eacute;zier path icon (<img src = "images/CreateRegularBezierPathIcon.gif" alt = "Create regular Bezier path icon" width = "26" >) in the Pen tool control bar that appears when you click on the Pen tool.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/CurvedPath.gif" alt = "Curved path"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Click and drag to create a curved path.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Continue clicking and dragging at various locations on the page. The goal for this exercise is not to create anything specific, but to get you accustomed to the feel of the B&eacute;zier curve.</p>

    <p>Notice that as you click and drag, direction handles appear that end in round direction points. The angle and length of the direction handles determine the shape and size of the curved segments. Direction lines do not print and are not visible when the anchor is inactive.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Choose Edit &gt; Deselect.</li>

    <li><p>Choose the Node tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >) and select a curved segment to display the direction handles again. Moving the direction points reshapes the curves.</p>

    <p><i><b>Note:</b> Endpoints are diamond-shaped, and, when selected, appear red when the cursor is on them,
    blue when the cursor is off them; unselected, they appear grey. Anchor points in the middle of a line or curve segment are squares. Like segment endpoints, they are red when selected and the cursor is on them, blue when selected and the cursor is off them. Direction points are circles. These lines and points do not print with the artwork.</i></p>

<aside style = "background-color: #ffccff;">
<header><h3>Components of a Path</h3></header>
<p>A smooth anchor point always has two direction handles that move together as a single, straight unit. When you drag the direction anchor point of either direction line on a smooth anchor point, both direction handles move simultaneously, maintaining a continuous curve at that anchor point.</p>
<figure>
    <img src = "images/CurvedPathAnatomy.gif" alt = "Anatomy of a curved path"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption><b>A.</b> Anchor point. <b>B.</b> Direction line.<br>
    <b>C.</b> Direction point (or handle).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In comparison, a corner point can have two, one, or no direction handles, depending on whether it joins two, one, or no curved segments, respectively. Corner point direction handles maintain the corner by using different angles. When you drag a direction point on a corner point's direction line, the other direction line, if present, does not move.</p>
</aside>

<section>
<header><h2>Building a Curve</h2></header>
<p>In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to control the direction handles
in order to control curves.</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Open the file named <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/Tutorial04Image03.svg" ><b>Tutorial04Image03.svg</b></a> from the Tutorial04 folder.

    right-click or press &lt;Enter&gt;.</li>

    <li><p>Click and drag at the left base of path "B," again in the direction of the arch. Click and drag down on the next square point, adjusting the arch with the direction handle before you release the mouse.

Inkscape, by default, lets you undo a series of actions &ndash; limited only by your computer's memory &ndash; by repeatedly choosing Edit &gt; Undo or pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z.</p>

    <p><i><b>Tip:</b> You have the ability to undo and redo multiple times in Inkscape. When you use the Edit menu, you will see a description of the change that would happen. Multiple steps can be undone using the Edit &gt; Undo History command. For more details, go to Help &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; 4. Editing Basics &gt; Undo and Redo.</i></p>

<p>When creating curves, the directional handles help to determine the slope of the path. Returning to a corner point requires a little extra effort. In this next portion of the lesson, we will practice converting curve points to corners.</p>

<header><h2>Drawing Curves</h2></header>
<p>In this part of the tutorial, you will review drawing curves by drawing the pear, its stem, and a leaf. You'll examine a single curve and then draw a series of curves together, using the template guidelines to help you.</p>

<h3>Selecting a Curve</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Choose the Zoom In or Out tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom In or Out icon" width = "26" >) in the toolbox.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the Zoom In or Out tool still selected, click-drag a marquee around the Curved Line in the upper right
    corner of the template image.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectedCurve.gif" alt = "Selected curve"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting the Curved Line to enlarge it.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectedCurveMagnified.gif"
        alt = "Magnified curve"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Result.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Using the Edit Nodes tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif"
    alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >), click on the curve once to selected the entire curve. Note the grey deselcted endpoint anchors.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectedCurveDeselectedEndpoints.gif"
        alt = "Magnified curve with deselected endpoints"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>First click &ndash; curve shows deselected endpoints.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the curve a second time with the Edit Nodes tool. The endpoints are colored blue (red when
    you put the cursor over them), direction handles appear that extend from the endpoints, and a hand appears
    near the cursor signaling that you can now edit the curve. The Edit Nodes tool lets you select and edit
    individual segments in the curved line.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectedCurveDirectionHandles.gif"
        alt = "Magnified curve with direction handles"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Second click &ndash; curve shows selected endpoints and direction handles.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>By selecting a curve, you also select the paint attributes of the curve, so that the next line you draw will have those same attributes. There will be more on paint attributes in an upcoming tutorial.</p>
</section>

<section>
<header><h2>Drawing the Leaf</h2></header>
<p>Now you'll draw the first curve of the leaf.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Choose the Zoom In or Out tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom In or Out icon" width = "26" >) in the toolbox.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the Zoom In or Out tool still selected, click-drag a marquee around the Leaf Step 1 image in the middle right
    side of the template image.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MagnifyLeaf.gif"
        alt = "Selected leaf curve image"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting the Leaf Step 1 image to enlarge it.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MagnifyLeafResult.gif"
        alt = "Magnified leaf curve"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Result.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Instead of dragging the Pen tool to draw a curve, you will drag it to set the starting point and the direction of the line&lsquo;s curve. When you release the mouse button, the starting point is created and a direction handle is formed. Then you drag the Pen tool to the end of the first curve and to set the start point and direction of the next curve on the line.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Pen tool" width = "26" >) and then select the Create Regular B&eacute;zier path icon
    (<img src = "images/CreateRegularBezierPathIcon.gif" alt = "Create regular Bezier path icon"
    width = "26" >) in the Pen tool control bar. Position the Pen tool over point A
    on the template. Press the left mouse button and drag from point A to the red dot.
    Then release the mouse button.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/FirstDirectionHandle.gif"
        alt = "Creating the first direction handle"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Result.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Next you'll set the second anchor point and its direction handles.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Without click-dragging, move the left mouse button to point B and then click-drag to the next red dot.
    Release the mouse button. Inkscape connects the two anchor points with a curve that follows the direction
    handles you have created. Notice that if you vary the angle of dragging, you change the amount of curve.</p>

to a corner point and a corner point to a smooth point. Make a simple teardrop path first.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><i>Always drag the first direction point in the direction of the bump of the curve, and drag
	the second direction point in the opposite direction to create a single curve. Dragging both
	direction points in the same direction creates an S curve.</i></p>
	</li>
	<li><p><i>When drawing a series of continuous curves, draw one curve at a time, placing anchor points
	at the beginning and end of each curve, not at the tip of the curve.</i></p>

<header><h3>Painting the Artwork</h3></header>
<p>Now paint the objects as you like. You will use the <b>Style Indicator</b>, which is an area
in the lower left corner of the window containing the Fill Box, Stroke Box, Stroke thickness, and
Opacity. In the color illustration at the beginning of this tutorial, the stroke on the leaf, the stem,
and the pear have been removed, and the fills were created with custom-made gradients. The arrow
is given a dark blue color. Details were drawn on the leaf, the stem, and the round part of the
pear using the paintbrush tool and the Pen tool. We also stroked the curve where the arrow pierces the pear.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Move the cursor to the Color palette. With the mouse wheel, roll the palette right or left until
    you see your color of choice. Click on the color box, click-drag it down and drop it in the <b>Fill</b> box of
    the <b>Style Indicator</b>. Your object is filled with that color. Alternatively, you can select the object
    you want to color-fill and just click on the box containing the color you want. For example:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/DragColorIntoFillBox.gif"
        alt = "Drag your color of choice into the Fill Box"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Dragging your color of choice into the Fill box of the Style Indicator.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/ColorFilledArrowhead.gif"
        alt = "Arrowhead filled with dark blue"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Arrowhead filled with dark blue.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now drag your color of choice down and drop it on the <b>Stroke</b> box of the Style Indicator to
    change the stroke color of a selected object. Because you applied dark blue to your object in the
    previous step, the Fill box is dark blue. The Fill and Stroke boxes can be very handy in showing you
    the color status of a selected object and manipulating its color.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/DragColorIntoStrokeBox.gif"
        alt = "Drag your color of choice into the Stroke Box"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Dragging your color of choice into the Stroke box of the Style Indicator.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/StrokeColorChanged.gif"
        alt = "Arrowhead given dark blue stroke"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Arrowhead given a dark blue stroke.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/StrokeColorBoxDarkBlue.gif"
        alt = "Stroke color box is now dark blue"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Stroke color box is now dark blue.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The <b>1.5</b> next to the Stroke color box indicates the thickness of the stroke in pixels.
    The <b>O</b> next to the <b>100</b> stands for the <b>opacity</b> (the opposite of transparency) of
    the selected object. The selected object is currently 100% opaque. Using the Opacity box allows you
    to set the degree of transparency from totally transparent (0%) to totally opaque (100%).</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The None color box (<img src = "images/NoneColorBox.gif" alt = "None color box"
    class = "center">) is a buggy feature. It works well if you want to delete a fill color. However,
    if you want to delete a stroke, you need to &lt;Shift&gt;-click on the None box. I recommend that
    you memorize this technique. It can come in very handy when you are manipulating both shape and
    color of an object.</p>

<header><h2>Exploring on Your Own</h2></header>
<p>Now that you've used the Pen tool to draw a pear with precise B&eacute;zier curves, try drawing the pear
using the Pencil tool to create a hand-drawn look. You can edit lines that you draw using the Pencil tool and
Edit Nodes tool to change their shape, and you can use the Pencil tool Tool Controls bar, Path Simplify command,
and Erase Existing Paths tool to edit the drawing further.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Open the <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial04/PearParts.svg"><b>PearParts.svg</b></a> file again and save it as <b>Pear2.svg</b>.
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the Pencil tool (<img src = "images/PencilTool.gif" alt = "Pencil tool" width = "26">)
    in the toolbox, and draw the pear on one continuous path without releasing the mouse button. To close the path,
    click-drag the Pencil tool cursor to the starting point, which is a small open square. The starting square will
    get a red fill when the cursor hovers above it, signaling that you can now close the path. Release the left mouse
    button. The path turns into a solid black path inside a bounding box.</p>

    <p>Anchor points are set down as you draw with the Pencil tool, and you can adjust them once the path is complete.
    The number of anchor points is determined by the length and complexity of the path and by the tolerance value
    set in the Inkscape Pencil tool Tool Controls bar. In the figure below, the smoothness tolerance is set to <b>10</b>.
    The Inkscape default value for the smoothness tolerance is <b>4</b>. The higher the number, the smoother the curve;
    the lower the number, the more irregular the curve.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/PencilToolControlBar.gif"
        alt = "Pencil tool control bar"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Pencil tool control bar. Smoothness tolerance is set to <b>10</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use the Pencil tool (<img src = "images/PencilTool.gif" alt = "Pencil tool" width = "26">) redraw the shape of the pear with different tolerance settings. Note how finely the pear path
    is defined with many anchor points at smoothness setting <b>10</b>, compared a redrawing done with
    a smoothness setting <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>An alternative to smoothing a rough-drawn path is the Simplify Path command. Use Path &gt; Simplify or
    press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L. One application of the Simplify Path command to the left-most drawing reduces the
    number of anchor points significantly, as you can see below.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/PencilToolSettings.gif"
        alt = "Pencil tool settings"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Pencil tool results from different tolerance settings and
        one application of the Simplify command (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-L).<br>
        Plain paths are shown in the top row, corresponding paths with nodes are shown in the bottom row.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SimplifyPathAppliedTwice.gif"
        alt = "Simplify path command applied twice"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Simplify Path command applied twice on an open path.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Depending on where you begin to redraw a path and in which direction you drag, you might get unexpected results.
    For example, you might unintentionally change a closed path to an open path, change on open path to a closed path,
    or lose a portion of a shape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use the Simplify Path command (Path &gt; Simplify or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L) to round out the shape of a curved
    segment (deleting anchor points if necessary).</p>
    <p>The number of anchor points is determined by the length and complexity of the new path, as well as by the
    smoothness tolerance values set in the Pencil tool Control bar (see 2. above).</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<aside>
<header><h3>Smoothing the Path with the Simplify Path command (Path &gt; Simplify or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L)</h3></header>
<p>The Simplify Path command lets you smooth out an existing stroke or path.
The Simplify Path command retains the original shape of the path as much as possible.</p>
<h4>To use the Simplify Path command:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>If the path you wish to smooth is not selected, select it with the Select tool.</li>
    <li>Do one of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Path &gt; Simplify.</li>
            <li>Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L (or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-l), the command is case-insensitive).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Continue choosing Path &gt; Simplify or pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-L (or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-l)
    until the stroke or path has the desired smoothness.</p>

    </li>
</ol>

<header><h2>Review answers</h2></header>
<ol>
    <li><p>To draw a straight line, you click twice with the Pen tool &mdash; the first click sets the starting
    anchor point, and the second click sets the ending anchor point of the line. To constrain the line vertically,
    horizontally, or along a 45° diagonal, hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; as you click with the Pen tool.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To draw a curved line using the Pen tool, you hold down the left mouse button and click-drag
    to create the starting anchor point and set the direction of the curve, and then you click to end the curve.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To draw a corner point on a curved line, click on the ending point of your first curve. Click-drag
    the direction handle on the endpoint of the curve to fine-tune the direction of the path. Either right-click or
    press &lt;Enter&gt; to finalize the curve segment. Then click on the endpoint and click-drag the cursor in
    the direction the next curve segment will take. Move the cursor to the next endpoint without click-dragging to
    draw the next curve.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Use the Edit paths by nodes</b> tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif"
    alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >) to select the anchor point,
    and then click on the Make Selected Nodes Corner icon <img src = "images/MakeSelectedNodesCornerIcon.gif"
    alt = "Make selected nodes corner icon" width = "26">) in the toolbar. &lt;Shift&gt;-drag
    a direction handle from the node to change the direction of one of the curves. If both curves have different
    starting angles, &lt;Shift&gt;-drag the mouse to create a direction handle for each side of the cusp.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>To edit a segment on a curved line, select the <b>Edit paths by nodes</b> tool
    (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >) and drag the segment to move it, or drag a direction handle on an anchor point
    to adjust the length and shape of the segment.</p>
