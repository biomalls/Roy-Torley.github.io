  <h2>Prepping for this tutorial</h2>
</header>

<ol>
  <li>Start Inkscape.</li>

  <li><p>Click on File &gt; Open and open the
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial03/Tutorial03Image01.svg"><b>Tutorial03Image01.svg</b></a> file in the Tutorial03 folder.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/FinishedProduct.gif"
      alt = "Logo image file for Tutorial 3"
      class = "img-fluid">
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller, adjust the window size,
  and leave it on your screen as you work. Move the artwork where you want it in the window using the &lt;Shift&gt;+
  arrow keys. If you don't want to leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now create the start file to begin the lesson.</p>

<ol start = "4" >
  <li><p>Choose File &gt; New to open a new, untitled document.</p></li>
  <li><p>Choose File &gt; Save As..., name the file <b>Logo</b>, and select the Tutorial03 folder
	in the Save In menu. Leave the default file format as <b>Inkscape SVG (*.svg)</b>. Inkscape
	will automatically append the filename with <b>.svg</b> as it saves.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

  <h2>Setting up the Document</h2>
</header>
<p>You'll begin this tutorial by</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>closing the color palette and Command toolbar that you won't use,</p></li>
    <li><p>displaying a grid to use as a guideline for drawing,</p></li>
    <li><p>setting the ruler units to inches,</p></li>
    <li><p>opening the Snap Controls bar to adjust the positioning of objects.</p></li>
    <li><p>Close the color palette by pressing &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+p or choosing View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Palette.
To close the Commands toolbar, choose View &gt; Show/Hide &lt; Commands Bar. For now, you won't need to use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose View &gt; Page Grid to display a grid that's useful for measuring, drawing, and aligning shapes.
  The grid won't print with the artwork.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the rulers are not visible along the top and left side of the window, choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Rulers to
  display them. The ruler units are set by default to pixels.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can change ruler units for the current document. The ruler unit of measure applies to measuring objects,
moving and transforming objects, setting grid and guide spacing, and creating ellipses and rectangles.
(It does not affect the units in the Character, Paragraph, and Stroke palettes.)
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Choose File &gt; Document Properties to change the ruler units for only this document.
In the Document Properties dialog box, click on the Grids tab, for Grid units choose inches in
the drop-down selection box (in).</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DocumentPropertiesDialog.gif"
    alt = "Document Properties dialog box, selecting units"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Choose <b>in</b> (inches) from the Grid units drop-down menu.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>We will now change the grid spacing so that squares measure 1/8 inch on each side. With the Document Properties dialog
still active, change the Spacing-X and Spacing-Y measurements to 0.125 (Press &lt;Enter&gt; after each entry). The grid
spacing now shows squares that measure 1/8 inch on each side.</p>

    alt = "Changing the grid spacing"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Changing the grid spacing.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>We will make the major grid lines a darker blue than they are currently. Click on the Major Grid Line Color bar.
The Major Grid Line Color dialog appears. Enter the numbers from the figure below to create major grid lines that are
colored navy blue:</p>

  <h2>Using Basic Shape Tools</h2>
</header>
<p>In this tutorial, you'll create a simple logo using the basic shape tools. The shape tools include the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create rectangles and squares tool (<img src = "images/CreateSquaresTool.gif" alt = "Create Squares tool"
        width = "26" >),</li>
  <li>Create circles, ellipses, and arcs tool (<img src = "images/CreateCirclesTool.gif" alt = "Create Circles tool" width = "26" >), and</li>
  <li>Create stars and polygons tool (<img src = "images/CreateStarsTool.gif" alt = "Create Stars tool" width = "26" >).</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Drawing the Pencil Shape</h2>
</header>
<p>In Inkscape, you control the thickness and color of lines that you draw by setting stroke attributes.
A stroke is the paint characteristics of a line or the outline of an object. A fill is the paint
characteristics of the inside of an object. The default settings will let you see the objects you
draw with a white fill and a black outline.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Select the Zoom tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom tool" width = "26" >)
  in the toolbox, and click in the middle of the window once or twice until you are zoomed in to about 150%.
  (Notice that 150%, more or less, is displayed in the bottom left corner of the window.)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose View &gt; Guides to turn them on. <b>Guides</b> automatically snap the edges of objects
	to nearby objects or their intersect points as you move them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside>
  <header>
    <h2>How Guides Work</h2>
  </header>
  <p>When <b>Guides</b> are turned on and you move the cursor over your artwork, the cursor looks for objects,
  page boundaries, and intersections of construction guides to snap to that are within the tolerance range set
  in File &gt; Document Properties &gt; Snap tab.</p>

  <p>You can use <b>Guides</b> in the following ways when you create, move, and transform objects.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you create an object with the pen or shape tools, use the <b>Guides</b> to position the new object's
    anchor points relative to the other object.
    </li>
    <li>When you move an object, use the <b>Guides</b> to align to the point on the object that you have selected.
    You can align to the anchor point at the corner of a selected object near the bounding box. To do so, select
    the object just inside the bounding box handle. If the tolerance is 5 pixels or greater, you can snap to the
    corner point from 5 pixels away.
    </li>
    <li>When you transform an object, <b>Guides</b> appear to assist the transformation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note</b>: When Snap to Grid is turned on, you cannot use <b>Guides</b> (even if the menu command is selected).
  </aside>

<ol start = "3">
  <li>Select the Create Rectangles and Squares tool (<img src = "images/CreateSquaresTool.gif" alt = "Create Squares tool" width = "26" >),
  and drag it to draw a rectangle that's 0.75 inches wide and 1 inch tall. (Use the rulers and the grid as guides.)
  This will be the body of the pencil.
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p>When you release the left mouse button, the rectangle is automatically selected and eight sizing handles appear on its bounding box. To move the rectangle, you will need to put the cursor on the edge of the rectangle and then drag it to its new location. Trying to move it by dragging on its interior will have no effect unless it has a color fill.</p>
</aside>

<ol start = "4">
  <li><p>Note the rectangle's height and width in the Tool Controls bar: <img src = "images/HeightWidthInfo.png" alt = "Height and width info" class = "img-fluid"></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If the rectangle's dimensions are not correct, as seen in the figure above, it's easy to change them.
  Click on the rectangle's edge if it isn't still selected. Then, click in the <b>W</b> (width) box and change
  the measurement to <b>.75</b>. Do the same with the <b>H</b> (height) box, changing the measurement to <b>1</b>.
  The rectangle's dimensions will update accordingly.</p>
  <p>You'll draw another rectangle centered inside the first one to represent the two vertical lines on the pencil.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the Rectangle tool still selected, position the pointer over the center point of the rectangle, hold
  down the &lt;Shift&gt; key, and drag out from the center point to draw a rectangle that's centered inside it.
  Release the mouse button when the rectangle is the same height as the first rectangle (1 inch). If the unit of
  measurement is not in inches (in), click in that box and choose <b>in</b> from the drop-down menu. In the width
  (W) box, change the measurement to 0.42 so the inner rectangle won't appear unnecessarily broad.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Holding down &lt;Shift&gt; as you drag the Rectangle tool draws the rectangle from its center point rather
than from its top left corner.</p>

<ol start = "7">

    <figcaption>&lt;Shift&gt;-drag to draw second rectangle</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Now you'll create a rounded rectangle for the eraser using the <b>Edit paths by nodes</b> tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose the Rectangle tool and create a 0.75 in &times; 0.75 in square using the grid lines to snap the
figure into a good position. Leave the square selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose the <b>Edit paths by nodes</b> tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif"
  alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width = "26" >).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Left click on the circular handle on the upper right corner of the square and drag it down by one grid square. Release the

  <img src = "images/RoundSquareCorners.png" alt = "Rounded square corners"
  class = "img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Drag the circular handle down one grid square length to round all four square corners.</figcaption>

  <p>You will now snap the eraser shape to the top of the pencil body.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Snap Controls Bar to display the Snap Controls bar above the window.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click the Selection tool if it is not already selected.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click on the edge of the rounded square to select it.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click on the Enable snapping button at the far left of the Snap Controls bar (<img src = "images/EnableSnappingButton.gif"
alt = "Enable snapping button" width = "26" >) to activate the snapping function.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Snap bounding boxes button which is the next button to the right of the Enable snapping button. It looks identical to the Enable snapping button but has a different tool tip description.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Snap midpoints of bounding box edges button (<img src = "images/SnapMidpointsOfBoundingBoxEdges.gif"
alt = "Snap midpoints of bounding box edges button" width = "26" >).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Drag the rounded square shape until it is close to the top of the pencil body and release the left mouse button. The eraser immediately shifts into place squarely on the top of the pencil body. If you under- or overshoot, just drag the erase into place and see the pulling action of the snapping function.</p>

  <img src = "images/SnappingEraserToPencilBody.gif"
  alt = "Snapping the eraser to the pencil body"
  class = "img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Result</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Next you'll create two shapes to represent the metal bands connecting the eraser to the pencil.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To prevent automatic snapping to a grid line that will misalign your objects, click on the Snap to
  grids button (<img src = "images/SnapToGrids.gif" alt = "Snap to grids button" width = "26" >)
  to turn the feature off. Keep the other snapping features on because they will help in aligning objects properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To make the first band, create a rounded box 1 square high and 8 squares long. Note that the corners are
  already rounded because the rounding function carries over into your next created rectangle or square.</p>

    <img src = "images/FirstBand.gif" alt = "Create first band"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Create the first band.</figcaption>

  <h2>Drawing the Piece of Stationery</h2>
</header>
<p>You can draw the diamond-shaped piece of stationery for the logo in a couple of ways. One way is to draw four-sided polygons
(using the same methods you used to draw the triangle for the pencil tip). Another way is to draw using the Rectangle tool,
and the Select and Transform tool.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Select the Rectangle tool (<img src = "images/RectangleTool.gif" alt = "Rectangle tool"
width = "26" >) in the toolbox, and position the pointer over the center point of the pencil body.
Hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; and drag the tool to draw a square of any size from the center of the pencil.</p>
<p>Holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key while dragging the Rectangle tool constrains the rectangle to a square.
  Holding down &lt;Shift&gt; draws the rectangle from its center point rather than from the top left corner. Holding down both the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys allows you to draw a square from its
	center point out.</p>
<p>How you'll use the <b>W</b> (width) and <b>H</b> (height) text boxes to enter precise dimensions for the square.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Type 2.25 in the <b>W</b> text box and 2.25 in the <b>H</b> text box. Press &lt;Enter&gt; to apply the changes.</p>

  <h2>Drawing with the Rectangular Grid Tool</h2>
</header>
<p>With the grid tool, you can create different types grids. You can generate rectangular (Cartesian) grids, concentric circles for polar grids, respectively, of a specified size with a specified number of dividers.</p>
<p>Now you'll add a grid to the stationery. Unlike the view grid, this grid can print.</p>

  <h2>Decorating the Stationery Border</h2>
</header>
<p>You'll decorate the border of the piece of stationery with a circle, a spiral, and some star shapes,
using different methods to create the shapes.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Press &lt;Alt&gt;-z to highlight the magnification text box in the lower right-hand corner of the window:

  </li>
  <li><p>Select the Ellipse tool (<img src = "images/CreateCirclesTool.gif" alt = "Ellipse tool" width = "26" >), and position the pointer in the left corner of the stationery border.
        Hold down &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Ctrl&gt; and drag the tool to draw a small circle.</p>

  <p>Holding down &lt;Ctrl&gt; as you drag the Ellipse tool constrains the shape to a circle;
  holding &lt;Shift&gt; draws it from its center point. Holding down &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Ctrl&gt; allows you to
  draw a circle from its center out.</p>
