<p>The Fill, Stroke paint, and Swatches palettes let you apply, modify, and save colors in your artwork.
You can paint with HSL, RGB, CMS, RGB, or CMYK colors; patterns; and gradients of blended colors.
With the Brushes palette, you can apply art or patterns to the path of an object.</p>

<h4>In this tutorial on the work area, you will learn how to:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Paint with, create, and edit colors.</li>
    <li>Name and save colors and build a color palette.</li>
    <li>Copy paint and appearance attributes from one object to another.</li>
    <li>Adjust the saturation of a color.</li>
    <li>Paint with gradients, patterns, and brushes.</li>
  </ul>
</header>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn about the variety of paint options in Inkscape as you paint an illustration of four hats. First, open the finished art file for this lesson to see what you'll create.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>If you haven't opened Inkscape, open it now.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial05FinishedImages.svg</b> file in the Tutorial05 folder.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/Tutorial05FinishedImages.gif"
            alt = "Tutorial 05 finished images"
            class = "img-fluid">
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>If you like, choose View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller and leave it on your
    screen as you work. (Use &lt;Shift&gt;-roll the mouse wheel and roll without using the &lt;Shift&gt; key to
    move the artwork where you want it in the window.) If you don't want to leave the image open,
    choose File &gt; Close.</p>

    <aside><i><b>Tip:</b> For an illustration of the finished artwork in this tutorial, go to the beginning of this tutorial.</i>
    </aside>
    <p>Now open the start file to begin this lesson.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial05StartingImages.svg</b> file in the Tutorial05 folder.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/Tutorial05StartingImages.gif"
            alt = "Tutorial 05 starting images"
            class = "img-fluid">
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Save As, name the file <b>Hats.svg</b>, and select the Tutorial05 folder in the Save As menu.</p>
    </li>

<header><h2>Filling with Color</h2></header>
<p>Painting objects with colors, gradients, or patterns is done using a combination of palettes and tools &mdash;
including the Color palette, the Swatches palette, the Gradient palette, the Stroke palette, and the paint buttons
in the toolbox &mdash; that let you select and change an object's paint and line attributes.</p>
<p>You'll begin by filling an object with color. Filling an object paints the area enclosed by the path.</p>
<p>The Color palette appears automatically on-screen when starting Inkscape.</p>
<p>(If the Color palette isn't visible, display it by choosing View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Palette; a check mark
indicates that the palette is open on-screen.)</p>
<figure>

<aside><i><b>Note:</b> you can scroll across the Color palette by placing the mouse cursor on the palette and rolling
the mouse wheel one way or the other. There are more colors on the palette than are shown here. Scroll across the
whole palette to get a sense of how colors are organized.</i>

    <li><p>Choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Tools &gt; Selector &gt; Per-object selection cue &gt; None. Exit out
    of the dialog window by clicking on the <b>X</b> box in the upper right-hand corner of the dialog box. The bounding
    box is useful for moving and resizing objects. You won't need this option for this tutorial.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox, and then click on the rectangular border around the top left block in
    the artwork to select the object.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the dialog box, notice that the <b>Fill</b> tab is active, indicating that it is selected.
(This is the default.) The <b>RGB</b> tab is active, indicating that we are using the <b>Red-Green-Blue</b>
mode of identifying color (this mode is Inkscape's default way of describing color). The <b>Opacity</b> box
indicates that the border color is 100% opaque. Note the R, G, and B color settings. The <b>A</b> (Alpha
channel or Opacity setting) is set to 100%.  The <b>Blur (%)</b> setting is set to 0.</p>

<p>The <b>Opacity</b> and <b>Blur</b> settings both can affect the color of your artwork. You'll change transparency and blurring later in this lesson. For more information on using Opacity, see Help &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; Comprehensive Index &gt; O &gt; Opacity &gt; Display.  There is a lot of information in the manual, so be prepared for a deluge of good information and technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <b>Stroke paint</b> tab. The <b>Stroke paint</b> color icon is selected and the Opacity is set to 100%.
See how the RGB color settings are different from the Fill tab color settings, reflecting the color inside
the box border.</p>

<p>Click on the <b>Stroke style</b> tab. See how the box border has a width of <b>5.000 pixels</b>. Immediately
underneath the Stroke width fields, you can see that corner joints are set to a square <b>Miter join</b>.

<p>We will use the <b>CMYK</b> color scheme in this tutorial.  <b>CMYK</b> stands <b>C</b>yan, <b>M</b>agenta,
<b>Y</b>ellow, and blac<b>K</b>. CMYK colors are known as <i>process colors</i> in that cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black inks are typically used for color separations in the printing industry. Click on the <b>Fill</b> tab,
and then on the <b>Flat color</b> icon. Click on the <b>CMYK</b> button to activate the CMYK color feature.
The CMYK sliders in the <b>Fill</b> palette show the colors' percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
The Style Indicator, in the lower left of the screen, displays the current color for the fill and stroke.

<ol start = "5">
    <li>Now click a yellow color in the color bar to select the color. You can adjust the color by dragging
    the CMYK sliders in the Color palette. (We selected a yellow color with these values: C = 0%,
    M = 2%, Y = 49%, K = 0%, and A = 100%.) The color is updated in the Fill box in the Attribute box and in
    the Color Palette, as well as in the artwork.

</header>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll outline the squiggly area around the bottom left hat. Painting just the outline of an
object is called <i>stroking</i>.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">), click the squiggly shape around the hat in the bottom left rectangle to select it.
        <figure>
    <img src = "images/AttributeBox2.png" alt = "Updated Attribute box"
    class = "img-fluid">

    <figcaption>Select the squiggly shape in the bottom left rectangle.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The Fill box in the Style Indicator displays a pale green color. The Stroke box is transparent against the background
        and has the word <i>None</i>, which is the current color value of the object's stroke.</p>
    <p>You'll start by exchanging the fill color and the stroke color.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Stroke paint</b> tab in the Color palette.  Click on the <b>Flat color</b> icon in the palette. If
    you haven't been working with stroke colors earlier, the Color palette for stroke color will show you that the
    squiggly shape now has a black stroke, as you can see below.
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/AttributeBox3.png"
        alt = "Updated Attribute box" class = "img-fluid">

    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Dropper tool</b> icon (<img src = "images/PickColorFromImage.gif" alt = "Pick color from image icon" width = "26" >). The icon now has a dotted outline showing that it is active.</li>
    <li>Move the cursor onto the squiggly shape. Note how the cursor has changed into an eyedropper with a crosshair at its
    tip (the color selection point). The dotted square to the right indicates that the <i>stroke color</i> is to be changed.
    <br><br>
    <aside><b>Note:</b> If you see a square with a <u>solid border</u>, that means that you are going to change the <i>fill color</i>
    of a shape.

		</aside>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the squiggly shape and see how it expands a little bit as the non-colored stroke now has the same color as the
    inside of the shape. The <b>Style Indicator</b> and <b>Stroke paint</b> palette have updated accordingly.
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/AttributeBox4.gif"

        <p>We now eliminate the fill color.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Fill</b> tab and then click on the <b>No paint</b> button. There is a green stroke, but no fill
    color.
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/AttributeBox5.gif" alt = "Updated Attribute box"
        class = "img-fluid">

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The squiggly shape now has no fill.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      The Fill box now has no fill (a fill of "None"), and the Stroke box has a pale green color. (The color will become apparent in the next step.) With a fill of None, you can see through to the fill underneath — in this case, the gray color of the rectangle's fill.
      <p>
      Now you'll change the weight of the curve that you just stroked using the <b>Stroke style</b> palette.
      <i>Stroke weight</i> is the thickness of a line. The <b>Stroke style</b> palette is grouped with the <b>Fill</b>
      and <b>Stroke paint</b> palettes. The green curve has a weight of 1 point.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      With the squiggly shape still selected, click on the <b>Stroke style</b> tab.  If the shape has been deselected,
      then the features in the <b>Stroke style</b> palette will be appear grey and unhighlighted.  Click on the curve
      to reselect it, if this is the case.  Features in the <b>Stroke palette</b> become highlighted, and thus active.
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/StrokeStylePalette1.gif"

      </li>
      <li>Type <b>7</b> in the <b>Width</b> text box and press &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; to change the stroke weight to 7 points. The squiggly line now stands out.

colors to the RGB mode in which the file is saved, RGB being Inkscape's native color storage mode.</p>

<h2>Saving and Naming a Color Swatch</h2>
<p>The <b>Swatch</b> palette stores the colors, gradients, and patterns that have been preloaded into Inkscape, as well as those you create and save for reuse. New colors added to the <b>Swatch</b> palette are saved with the current file. Opening a new artwork file displays the default set of swatches that comes with the Inkscape program.</p>

<p>You will now add the light orange color you just mixed to the <b>Swatch</b> palette so it will be stored
with this artwork file. You can select a color to add from either the <b>Fill</b> or <b>Stroke paint</b> palettes.
Even though you deselected the artwork, the light orange color is still the current color in the <b>Fill</b> box
in both the Style Indicator and the Fill palette.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If the artwork is deselected, select the orange area you just created in the middle of the lower left hat.
    Note how the Style Indicator and Fill palette change to reflect the color status of the orange area.<br>

<h2>Copying Paint Attributes</h2>
<p>Inkscape lets you copy paint attributes of objects (such as their fill and stroke colors) in various ways and apply the attributes to other objects.</p>

<p>You'll use the Dropper tool to copy colors from your artwork into the <b>Fill</b> palette. Also called
<i>sampling</i>, copying colors lets you replicate paint attributes even when you don&lsquo;t know their exact values.</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the bottom left rectangle, click the gray top of the hat with the Select tool
    (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) to highlight it.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectHatTop.gif" alt = "Hat top selected"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Select top of hat.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Select the Dropper tool (<img src = "images/PickColorFromImage.gif" alt = "Eyedropper pointer" >) in the <b>Fill</b> palette. The highlighting arrows around the top of the hat
    disappear temporarily.<br><br>
    By default, the Dropper tool samples the color fill and stroke attributes of an object.<br><br>
    <aside><b>Note:</b> the Dropper tool is not active when an object is not selected.
    Once an object to be painted or repainted is selected, the Dropper tool is active and ready
    for color sampling.<br>

<h2>Copying Appearance Attributes</h2>
<p>Inkscape lets you copy appearance attributes that include both the fill and the stroke of an object as well as its transparency and effects.</p>

<p>You'll create a drop shadow shape and change its transparency. Then you'll apply the shadow's appearance to another shape.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox, and click the hat brim in the upper right rectangle.<br>
    </li>

    <li>With the hat brim selected, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-d to make a copy of the brim (think <b>d</b> for
    <b>d</b>uplicate), and drag the copy slightly down and to the right. Release the mouse button to leave
    a copy of the hat brim. This copy will become a drop shadow.<br>
    </li>

    <li>Choose Object > Lower 5 times to move the shadow shape underneath the hat brim. You should still be able to see both the shadow shape and the hat brim.<br><br>
    <aside><b>Note:</b> Pressing the &lt;page down&gt; key will also lower the hat brim in the figure stacking order. It's a good feature to memorize.
    </aside>
    <br>
    </li>

    <li>With the object (in this case, the hat's shadow) still selected, use the Stroke paint palette to
    change its stroke to <b>None</b> by clicking on the <b>No paint</b> icon.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">

    press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the transparency, or drag the slider bar indicator to 50.0 using the mouse. If
    you choose to use the slider bar indicator, note how the cursor pointer changes from an arrowhead to an
    upward-pointing stylized arrow (<img src = "images/UpwardPointingArrow.gif" alt = "Upward-pointing arrow" >).<br>

    <h2>Saturating a Color</h2>
</header>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll adjust the saturation of the new color you added to the hat&rsquo;s top by
changing the percentage of black in the color.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">), click the top of the hat in the bottom left rectangle to select it. Make sure that the
    <b>Fill</b> palette is selected.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/HatTopSelected.gif" alt = "Hat top selected."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Hat top selected.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>

    <li>In the Fill palette, hold down &lt;Shift&gt; and drag the <b>M</b> slider to the left to desaturate
    the color. As you &lt;Shift&gt;-drag, the sliders all move in tandem, changing the color intensity.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/HatTopDesaturated.gif"
        alt = "Magenta in hat top desaturated."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Magenta in hat top desaturated.</figcaption>
    </figure><br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>&lt;Shift&gt;-drag left to desaturate<br>the magenta in the color mix.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;" ></div>

    <p>Adjusting the saturation lets you change the strength of a color without affecting the hue. (However, if you drag a slider that is set to 0%, you will change the hue or color of the object, rather than the color's saturation.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click away from the artwork, and choose File &gt; Save.<br>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/LessMagenta.gif"
            alt = "Magenta desaturated."

<h2>Painting with Patterns</h2>
<p>In addition to process and spot colors, you can also create your own pattern swatches. Inkscape provides features
with which you can create your own patterns.</p>
<p>Now you'll fill some objects with a pattern, working with the hat in the top right rectangle.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">), click in the center of the hat ribbon shape in the top right rectangle. The Fill box in the Attribute
    box shows that the shape's current fill is a very light yellow (<b>Y</b> = <b>4</b>).<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;" >
        <img src = "images/AttributeBoxLightYellowFill.gif"
        alt = "Attribute Box shows a light yellow fill."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Attribute box shows a<br>very light yellow fill.</figcaption>

        alt = "Hat ribbon selected."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Hat ribbon selected.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure style = "float: left;" >
        <img src = "images/FillPaletteLightYellow.gif"
        alt = "Fill palette shows a light yellow fill."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Fill palette shows a very light yellow fill.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    <div style = "clear: left;" ></div>
    </li>
    <li>We will now create a new Inkscape-style repeating pattern from an a previously made <b>.svg</b> file.
    Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Colorfetti.svg</b> file in the Tutorial05 folder.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/Colorfetti.gif" alt = "Colorfetti svg file."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Colorfetti.svg image</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the image and choose Edit &gt; Copy or press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C to copy the image to the clipboard.
    </li>
    <li>Return to the <b>Hats.svg</b> window and paste the copy of the Colorfetti image to your workspace. (I
    pasted the image to the right of the four hats.)<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/ColorfettiPasted.gif"
        alt = "Colorfetti image pasted into the Hats.svg workspace"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Colorfetti images pasted into the Hats.svg workspace.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>With the Colorfetti image still selected, choose Object &gt; Pattern &gt; Objects to Pattern. You'll see
    the screen flicker as the image is converted into a pattern and stored in the Pattern Swatch library. You
    can now use the Colorfetti image as a fill pattern.<br><br>
    <aside>The <b>Pattern fill</b> palette appears in the Fill palette after you choose Objects to Pattern.
    The pattern is given a label. Here, it is <b>pattern11286</b>.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/pattern11286.gif"
        alt = "New pattern stored as pattern17089."

        <figcaption>The new pattern is stored as <b>pattern11286</b>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </aside>
    </li>
    <li>Delete the copied Colorfetti image. Colorfetti still resides in the Pattern Swatch library. If
    the ribbon area of the hat is deselected, reselect it. Click on the <b>Pattern</b> button. The Colorfetti
    pattern fills the ribbon band.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/ColorfettiRibbonBand.gif"
        alt = "Colorfetti pattern now fills the ribbon band."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The Colorfetti pattern now fills the ribbon band.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Now select the background of the top right rectangle. Make sure that the Fill palette is selected,
    and click the same pattern swatch so the rectangle's fill is with the same pattern.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/ColorfettiBackground.gif"
        alt = "Colorfetti pattern now fills the background."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>The Colorfetti pattern now fills the background.
        (Background hasn&rsquo;t been deselected yet.)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
</ol>
    <aside>The new pattern swatch that you created exists only for this workspace. If you want to use this pattern
    in another image file, you will have to copy the original <b>.svg</b> image into your workspace just as you
    did earlier here, and transform it from an object into a pattern by using Object &gt; Pattern
    &gt; Objects to Pattern. Then you can use it as a fill pattern.

<h2>Applying a Gradient</h2>
<p>Now you'll apply an orange-to-yellow gradient to the first block in the illustration.</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the top left rectangle, select the squiggly curve around the hat with the Edit by nodes tool (<img src =

<h2>Painting with the Pattern Along Path Extension</h2>
<p>Patterns can be applied to existing paths or objects using an <b>extension</b>. Extensions are scripts or
programs that have been added to Inkscape to enhance its capabilities and functionality.</p>
<p>Here, we will use the <b>Pattern Along Path</b> extension.</p>

    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Select both the olive branch figure and the edge of the squiggly area around the lower right-hand hat.
    Remember: when selecting more than one object, use &lt;Shift&gt;+click to include other objects to your
    first one. See Tutorial 2, Selecting Objects, for review.<br>

    <li>Choose <b>Extensions</b> &gt; <b>Generate from Path</b> &gt; <b>Pattern along Path...</b> The
    Pattern along Path dialog box appears. Select <b>Copies of the pattern: Repeated</b>,
    <b>Deformation type: snake</b>, and check the boxes for <b>Duplicate the pattern before deformation</b>
    and <b>Live preview</b> to view different settings applied to the artwork without closing the dialog box.<br>

    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click the <b>Apply</b> button. The "'Pattern along Path' working" box appears for a few seconds while the
    extension program creates duplicates of the olive branch figure and places them over the edge of the
    squiggly area.<br>

        <figcaption>Pattern along Path diagnostic box.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>The diagnostic box disappears and the edge of the squiggly area is now dressed with an olive-branch
    design.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/OliveBranchEdge.gif"
        alt = "Olive branch design around the hat's squiggly area."

        <figcaption>Result.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Try out different settings to see how they affect the pattern on the squiggly shape, such as <b>Single,
    stretched</b>, or changing the <b>Space between copies</b>, <b>Normal offset</b>, and/or <b>Tangential offset</b>.
    When you're satisfied with the settings, click <b>OK</b> to apply them to the artwork.

<h2>Review Answers</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To fill an object with color, select the object and the <b>Fill</b> or <b>Stroke paint</b> tabin the <b>Fill and Stroke paint</b> palette. Then do one of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Click a color in the color bar in the Color palette.</li>
            <li>Drag the color sliders or type in values in the text boxes in the Fill palette.</li>
            <li>Click a color swatch in the Swatches palette.</li>
            <li>Select the Dropper pointer (<img src = "images/PickColorFromImage.gif"
								alt = "Eyedropper pointer" >), and click a color in the artwork.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To name a color, click on the Swatch icon in the Fill palette (<img src = "images/SwatchIcon.gif"
    alt = "Swatch icon" >). Click in the Name field in the Swatch fill palette to
    highlight the number, type the name of the new color in the name field, and click away from the
    field to set the name.</li>
    <li>To paint a shape with a transparent color, select the shape and fill it with any color. Then adjust
    the <b>Opacity (%)</b> control at the bottom of the <b>Fill</b> or <b>Stroke paint</b> palette to less than 100%.</li>
    <li>To desaturate a CMYK color, select the color and drag its slider to the left in the Fill or Stroke paint palette. Dragging the slider causes the other sliders to move in tandem so the hue won't change.</li>
