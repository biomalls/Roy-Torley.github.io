			<h1>From the Top</h1>
<p>Inkscape is a professional-quality vector-graphics software program
which runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Design professionals and hobbyists
worldwide use it to create a mind-boggling variety of graphics, including
illustrations, icons, logos, diagrams, maps, and web graphics. It uses
W3C open standard SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its native format, and,
very importantly, it is free and open-source software.</p>

<h2>About This Tutorial</h2>

<p>The wheel has been invented a long time ago.  However, whenever a new model of
bicycle or car is designed, a new model of tire might have to be created along with
it to ensure driving ease and comfort.  This series of tutorials can be considered as a new
tire for a new design of computer illustration program.  Its underlying principle is
that you learn by doing, so the approach is hands-on. Lessons are step-by-step.
You learn at your own pace.</p>

<p>Inkscape 1.0 has been around since 1 May 2020. This version of the tutorial,
meant for version 0.98, is out-of-date. Although all the functionality still
exists in version 1.0 in addition to much more, some of it is not located
where you expect it to be as per this tutorial. I'll be fixing those details
when I make time to edit. So, please be patient. I also intend to make
this tutorial's design more responsive as I introduce Bootstrap
functionality. Slow, but sure wins the race.</p>

<p>Each chapter contains a project for you to create.  As you work on each aspect of the
project, you learn new concepts and techniques. You are also invited to explore,
experiment, and just play with what you're learning.</p>

<p>Images created for this tutorial were created using Inkscape and Irfanview in
combination with each other on a Windows 7-based PC.

<h2>What You Need to Know Before You Start</h2>
<p>You need to be comfortable with your computer and its operating system.  Know how to
work with the keyboard, mouse, menus, commands.  Also, be familiar with opening, saving,
and closing files.  Review any printed or online Windows documentation if necessary.</p>
