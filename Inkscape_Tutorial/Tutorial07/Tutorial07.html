<h4>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Select, scale, move, rotate, and shear individual objects and objects in a group.</li>
    <li>Rotate objects using default rotation centers and centers that you have moved.</li>
    <li>Use the <b>Transform</b> palette to modify the shape of an object with precision.</li>
    <li>Work with snap guides and snap objects to guide lines.</li>
  </ul>
</header>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll transform parts of a logo to use in three pieces of artwork to create a letterhead design,
an envelope, and a business card template.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start Inkscape.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Composite.svg"><b>Composite.svg</b></a> file in the Lesson07 folder.<br><br>
    This file contains a composite of the three pieces of finished artwork. The Citrus Bath &amp; Soap logo
    in the top left corner of the letterhead is the basis for all the modified objects. The logo has been
    resized for the letterhead, envelope, and business card.<br><br>

    <aside><b>Note:</b> You can also view the individual pieces of finished artwork by opening the files
    <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07EndLetterhd.svg"><b>Tutorial07EndLetterhd.svg</b></a>, <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07Envelope.svg"><b>Tutorial07Envelope.svg</b></a>, and <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07EndBusCard.svg"><b>Tutorial07EndBusCard.svg</b></a> in the Lesson07 folder.
		</aside>
		<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you like, use the Zoom tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom In/Out tool" width = "26">) to reduce the view of the finished artwork, adjust the window size, and leave it on your screen
    as you work. (Use the mouse wheel with and without pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key to move the artwork where
    you want it in the window.) If you don't want to leave the image open, choose File &gt; Close.<br><br>

    To begin working, you'll open an existing file set up for the letterhead artwork.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07StartLetterhd.svg"><b>Tutorial08StartLetterhd.svg</b></a> file
    in the Tutorial07 folder. This start file has been saved with the rulers showing
    in inches, custom swatches added to the Swatches palette, and blue guidelines for
    scaling the logo and objects on the letterhead.<br>

            alt = "Starting image for Tutorial 07"
            class = "img-fluid">
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Save As, name the file <b>Letterhead.svg</b>, select the Tutorial07 folder,
    and click on <b>Save</b>.
    </li>

<header><h2>Scaling Objects</h2></header>
<p>You scale objects by enlarging or reducing them horizontally (along the x axis) and vertically
(along the y axis) relative to a fixed point of origin that you designate. If you don't designate
an origin, the objects are scaled from their center points. You'll use three methods to scale the
logo and two objects copied from the logo.</p>

<p>First you'll use the Transform palette to scale down the logo by entering new dimensions and
designating the point of origin from which the logo will scale.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) in the toolbox, click the logo to select the group of objects (type, background, lemon, orange slice, lime slice) that make up the logo.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Object &gt; Transform to display the Transform palette. The Transform palette appears
    docked on the right side of the screen.<br><br>
    The Transform palette contains options for moving, scaling, rotating, skewing, and distorting an object
    by manipulating the handles of its bounding box. You can move an object relative to a point of origin
    of your choosing or absolute position on the artboard, scale an object keeping or not keeping aspect
    ration, and distort an object by editing its matrix or creating a new matrix. For more information than
    what is presented in this tutorial, choose Help &gt; Inkscape Manual &gt; Positioning and Transforming
    &gt; Transformations.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/TransformPalette.gif" alt = "Transform palette"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Transform palette.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Scale</b> tab. Set the unit of measurement to points (<b>pt</b>) if it is
    not set to points already. Set the width to <b>83.75</b> points and the height to <b>8.5</b> points.
    Click on the <b>Apply</b> button. The logo is now resized to your measurements.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/LogoScaledDown.gif" alt = "Resized logo"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Logo scaled down.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>You will now move the logo to the upper left-hand corner of the page.<br><br>
    If the Snap Controls Bar is not visible, choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Snap Controls Bar. A check mark
    will appear to the left of the Snap Controls Bar option when you click on the option and the bar will
    appear.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>If the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon (<img src = "images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif"
    alt = "Enable snapping icon" >) isn't highlighted, click on it to activate it.
    Then, click on the <b>Snap guides</b> icon (<img src = "images/SnapGuidesIcon.gif" alt = "Snap Guides icon"
    width = "26">) to activate its functioning.<br><br>

    <aside><b>Note:</b> The <b>Enable snapping</b> feature acts as a master switch that allows activating all other
    snapping features under it, including the <b>Snap guides</b> function. If the particular snapping
    feature you want to use is not highlighted, check to see whether the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon
    is highlighted. If it's off, turn it on, then turn your option on.
		</aside>
		<br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the logo with the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) and drag the logo to the upper left-hand
    corner of the artboard where it fits into the small square defined by four guide lines.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/LogoMoved.gif" alt = "Logo now moved"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Logo moved to upper left-hand corner.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    The upper part of the page should appear similar to the figure below.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/UpperPartOfPage.gif" alt = "Upper part of page"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Upper part of page showing ruler.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Next you'll copy the background object in the logo and scale the new object by dragging
    its bounding box to fit the background of the letterhead.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>With the logo still selected, choose Object &gt; Ungroup to ungroup the larger
    group in the logo. See how the smaller subgroups remain grouped.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>If desired, use the Zoom tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif"
    alt = "Zoom In/Out tool" width = "26">) to zoom in on the logo.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool"
    width = "26">), click away from the logo to deselect it, and then
    click below the word Bath to select the light-blue background object in the logo.
    Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the background image. All the objects in the logo
    become darkened a little bit because there is now a copy of the background color, which is
    actually a gradient, on top of all the objects. Now drag the copy the background to the
    bottom left corner of the page, aligning it with the snap guides. You can press the arrow keys
    to nudge it into place.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/BackgroundMoved.gif"
        alt = "Move the background object."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Move the background object.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Next, you'll make this background object the background for the page.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Drag the top right corner of the new object's bounding box up to the top right side
    of the blue letterhead guide, to just below the return address.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/EnlargingBackground.gif"
        alt = "Enlarging the background object."
        class = "img-fluid">

        <figcaption>Background object scaled to the page.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    </li>
    <li>With the background object still selected, choose Object &gt; Object Properties, and click on the
<b>Lock</b> checkbox in the <b>Object Properties</b> palette to lock the object. Click away from the
background object to deselect it.  Locking the background object makes it easier to select other
objects you'll add to the artwork.<br><br>
You can also lock all artwork above the selected object &ndash; for example, if you want to edit
an object in the background that has objects on top of it — or all objects on other layers.
In addition, you can use the <b>Layers</b> palette to lock objects. Once objects are locked, they
cannot be selected or edited. You can quickly lock multiple objects, groups of objects,
and sublayers by locking the parent layer.<br><br>
The lemon in the logo is comprised of two objects grouped together. Now you'll copy and move the lemon and place it at the bottom of the letterhead.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
Click on the collection of citrus fruits in the lower part of the logo and choose Object &lt; Ungroup to separate them into three distinct objects. Select the lemon in the logo, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to copy it, and move the new lemon to the bottom right corner of the letterhead guide.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MovingLemon.gif"
        alt = "Move copy of lemon to lower right corner of page"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Move the copy of the lemon to the lower right corner of the page.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    You'll use the Scale tool to resize the new lemon.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Select the copy of the lemon if it isn't selected already.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Scale</b> tab in the <b>Transform</b> palette, set the unit of measurement to
    percent (<b>%</b>), set the width to 300 (300 percent), and click on the <b>Scale proportionally</b>
    checkbox to maintain the aspect ratio of width to height.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click the <b>Apply</b> button.<br><br>
    <figure>

<header><h2>Rotating Objects</h2></header>
<p>Objects are rotated by turning them around a designed point of rotation. You can rotate objects
by clicking on them twice, first to display their bounding boxes and handles to allow resizing, and
second to display handles to allow rotation and shearing. When the center of rotation appears after
the second click, you can rotate the object about that point. You can also drag that center of rotation
to any other location you want where it will still act as a center about which your object will
rotate.</p>

<p>You can rotate objects using the Transform palette to set a point of origin and a rotation angle. You can also rotate objects using the Rotate palette to set its rotation angle. In the examples below, the middle figure
shows a lemon object rotated about its default center of rotation. In the third example, the center of
rotation has been dragged outside the lemon and a rotation of 30 degrees applied using the <b>Rotate</b>
palette in the <b>Transform</b> palette.</p>

        <figcaption>Rotate palette, 30&deg;, clockwise<br>direction icon selected.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>

<p>You'll rotate the lemon 30° anticlockwise around its center point using the <b>Rotate</b> palette.</p>

<ol>
    <li>With the lemon selected, click on the <b>Rotate</b> tab to bring up the <b>Rotate</b> palette.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Type <b>30</b> in the <b>Angle:</b> text field, select the <b>Rotate anticlockwise</b> icon,
    and click on the <b>Apply</b> button.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/RotateLemon30Degrees.gif"
        alt = "Rotate lemon 30 degrees"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Rotate lemon 30&deg; anticlockwiseclockwise.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click away from the lemon object to deselect it. Your page will appear similar
    to the figure below.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/FullPage1.gif"
        alt = "Full page so far"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Full page image so far.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Save.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Now you'll create a flower. You will first create the sepals by distorting the edges of a star. You
will then create the petals by rotating copies of an ellipse, converting them into paths, and then
merging them into one object using the <b>Union</b> option for paths.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select the Star tool (<img src = "images/StarTool.gif" alt = "Star and polygon tool" >)
    in the toolbox, type <b>5</b> into the <b>Corners</b> text box to make a five-pointed star, leave the
    other settings at their default values, and position the pointer in the artwork next to the lemon.
    Drag the tool to draw a five-pointed star that's about the same size as the lemon.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeStar.gif"
        alt = "Make a five-pointed star"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Make a five-pointed star.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    The star is painted with the paint attributes of the last selected object (in this case,
    the lemon).<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>With the star still selected, click on the Lime Green swatch in the Color palette. Leave the
    stroke set to <b>None</b>.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/LimeGreenStar.gif"
        alt = "Change star color to lime green"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Change the star's fill color to lime green.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Now you'll distort the star by converting it from an object into a series of paths that you
    can manipulate individually.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Path &gt; Object to path.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Select the <b>Edit nodes</b> tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif"
    alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" >). Note how the star shape changes to
    show individual paths and nodes.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/StarAsPaths.gif"
        alt = "Star converted to paths"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Star converted into a series of nodes and paths.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Select each side of the star and drag the middle to the right a little bit to produce
    a twirl effect. When you're done, choose Edit &gt; Deselect to deselect the distorted star.
    You have created the flower sepals, which are the backmost part of the flower.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/CurvedStarSides.gif"
        alt = "Curving the star sides" width = "350"

        <figcaption>Result of distorting star object.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    Now you'll make the flower petals. You'll create a white ellipse, move its center of rotation to
    one end, and use a combination of &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to duplicate the ellipse and the <b>Rotate</b>
    palette to create the remaining four petals to create a five-petaled flower. You'll then
    convert the five ellipses into paths and then use the path <b>Union</b> option to merge them
    into one object.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Make an ellipse and color it white.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>With the ellipse still selected, choose Path &gt; Object to Path. Click on the ellipse again
    to bring up the rotate and shear handles. The center of rotation should (of course) appear in
    the center of ellipse. Drag the center of rotation to one end of the ellipse.<br>
    <figure style = "float: left;">
        <img src = "images/MakeWhiteEllipsePath.gif"
        alt = "Convert ellipse into a path"

    </figure>
    <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
    </li>
    <li>With the ellipse still selected, bring up the <b>Rotate</b> palette in the <b>Transform</b>
    palette. Type <b>72</b> in the <b>Angle:</b> text field (An angle of 72&deg; represents
    one-fifth of a full 360&deg; rotation). It doesn't matter which direction of
    rotation you choose.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to make a copy of the ellipse and click the <b>Apply</b> button in
    the <b>Rotate</b> palette. The copy of the petal is now rotated 72 degrees about its end.<br>

    </li>
    <li>With the second petal still selected, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to make a copy of that petal and
    click on the <b>Apply</b> button in the <b>Rotate</b> palette to rotate the newly copied petal.
    Repeat these steps two more times to create the remaining two petals.<br>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Five petals created.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Now shift-click all the unselected petals, or marquee-select them to group them. Choose
    Path &gt; Union to merge all the individual ellipse paths into one path.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/FivePetalsUnion.gif"
        alt = "Five petals made into one object"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Five petals merged into one object.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Move, magnify, and rotate the flower petal object on top of the lime-green sepal object.
    Enlarge the petal object so it is approximately the same size as the sepal object and rotate
    it so the petals are situated between the sepals.<br>

        <figcaption>The petal object on top of the sepal object.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Now you'll complete the body of the flower by adding an orange center. Using the <b>Circle</b>
    tool in the toolbox, create an ellipse about the same size and shape as a single petal. Move to the
    center of the flower.<br>

<header><h2>Shearing Objects</h2></header>
<p>You will now shear the flower. Shearing an object slants, or skews, the sides of the object
along the axis you specify, keeping opposite sides parallel and making the object nonsymmetrical.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Marquee select the whole flower and choose Object &gt; Group to group them into one object.

<header><h2>Positioning Objects Precisely</h2></header>
<p>You can use guide lines with snapping capabilities and the Transform palette to move objects to exact
coordinates on the x and y axes of the page and to control the position of objects in relation to a trim edge.</p>

<p>For this portion of the tutorial, you will create a new <b>svg</b> file that will contain artwork for
an envelope. This artwork will be a modified version of the letterhead logo you just finished.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; New.<br><br>
    A new Inkscape window appears with a blank artboard.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Save As...<br><br>
    Using the dialog window, navigate to the Tutorial07 folder and save the file as <b>envelope.svg</b>.
    <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Document Properties.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Select <b>Page Size:</b> US #10 Envelope 4.1 &times; 9.5 in. and uncheck the checkbox for
    <b>Border:</b> Show border shadow. The artboard drop shadow might be a distraction whereas
    a simple border might define your working area more clearly in this case.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/DocumentPropertiesFull.png"
        alt = "Full length Document Properties dialog box"
        width = "400" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Document Properties dialog box.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>X out of the Document Properties palette.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Zoom to fit page in window (5)</b> icon in the Commands Bar.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Extensions &gt; Render &gt; Layout &gt; Printing marks... Click on the <b>Marks</b> tab
    if that tab isn't already active. Check the <b>Crop Marks</b> checkbox if it isn't already checked
    and deselect any other checkboxes. Crop marks appear automatically at the corners of the envelope-shaped
    artboard.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/EnvelopeWithCropMarks.gif"
        alt = "Envelope with crop marks"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Envelope with crop marks.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Now you will make three guide lines to help in positioning the logo and address label on the
    envelope. To create the top guide line, click on the ruler at the top of the work window, left-click
    to create the guide line and drag it down until it is one quarter of an inch down from the top
    edge of the envelope. The line should be aligned at the 4&frac18;-inch mark on the left vertical ruler.
    The line turns blue when you release the left mouse button.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeTopGuideLine.gif"
        alt = "Make the top guide line." width = "600"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Make the top guide line.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Do the same thing to create a guide line for the bottom part of the envelope. Click on the ruler
    at the top of the work window again and drag the new guide line down until it is &frac14; of an inch
    from the bottom edge of the envelope. It will be aligned with the &frac14;-inch mark on the vertical
    ruler at the left side of the work window.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MakeRemainingGuideLines.png"
        alt = "Make the remaining guide lines." width = "600"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Make the remaining guide lines.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    We don't need to make a guide line for the right end of the envelope. We will not be putting any
    artwork there. The envelope artboard is ready to receive artwork from the letterhead file.<br><br>
    For more information on rulers, see Help &gt; Inkscape Manual. In the table of contents, choose
    <b>1. Quick Start</b> &gt; <b>The Anatomy of the Inkscape Window</b>. For more on guide lines, see
    <b>5. Positioning and Transforming</b> &gt; <b>Snapping</b> &gt; <b>Guides</b>.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Bring the letterhead artwork file that you were working on earlier. You can use the &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt;
    key combination to switch to the other active Inkscape window.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">), draw a marquee around the logo so that all the objects in it are selected.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Edit &gt; Copy to copy the logo to the Clipboard.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Press &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; again so you can switch back to the envelope Inkscape window.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Edit &gt; Paste. You'll move the pasted logo to within &frac14;-inch of the top left corner of the evelope by specifying the x and y coordinates in relation to the ruler origin. The ruler origin is the point where 0 appears on each ruler. The ruler origin in this file begins at the lower left corner of the envelope, and the ruler units are in inches.
    <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>If the Snapping Toolbar isn't visible, then choose View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Snap Controls Bar. Click on the
    <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> icon (<img src = "images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif"
    alt = "Enable snapping icon" width = "26" >) and the <b>Snap guides</b> icon (<img src = "images/SnapGuidesIcon.gif" alt = "Snap guides icon" width = "26" >) to make them active.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Drag the logo artwork to the upper left corner of the envelope where the guide lines intersect. A tooltip
    window appears when the upper left corner of the logo image is very close to the guide line intersection, signaling
    you of the image's proximity and that snapping to the corner will take place.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/MovingLogo.gif"
        alt = "Moving the logo to the upper left corner of the envelope."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving the logo image to the upper left corner of the envelope.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Release the mouse key and the logo image snaps into place.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Now go back to the letterhead artwork using &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;, marquee select the top two lines of the
    address and copy the block to the Clipboard using Edit &gt; Copy.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectAddress.gif"
        alt = "Select address" class = "img-fluid">

    Return to the envelope artwork (&lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;) again and use
    Edit &gt; Paste to paste the address onto the artboard.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose Object &gt; Transform.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Select <b>in</b> for unit of measurement if it isn't selected already, set both the <b>Horizontal</b>
    and <b>Vertical</b> placement to <b>0.25</b> so the lower left corner of the address block will be placed
    where the left-hand and bottom guide lines intersection. Uncheck the <b>Relative move</b> checkbox. You
    will move the lower left corner of the logo block to the absolute coordinates x = 0.25 inches,
    y = 0.25 inches, as you will see when you check where the guide lines intersect the left and top rulers.<br>
    <figure>

    </li>
    <li>The two lines of address text need to be aligned. You will use the <b>Align and Distribute</b> function to
    left-justify them.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>With the address block still selected (reselect it, otherwise), choose Object &gt; Align and Distribute.
    Click on the <b>Align baseline anchors of texts horizontally</b> icon. The two lines of address text line up

<h2>Reflecting Objects</h2>
<p>You can make mirror reflections of objects by flipping them across an invisible vertical or horizontal mirror.
There are two reflect functions available when the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) is active. They are located in the Commands Bar.</p>

        <img src = "images/ReflectionIcons.png" alt = "Reflection icons"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Reflection Icons.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Now you'll use the Vertical Reflect tool (<img src = "images/VerticalReflectTool.gif"
    alt = "Vertical Reflect tool" width = "26" >) to make a mirror image of the
    orange slice in the logo.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Use the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) to select the orange slice in the logo.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Zoom in if necessary.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to make a copy of the orange slice. You'll see the image flicker a little
        bit as the copy is made and placed directly on top of the original orange slice.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>With the duplicated orange slice still selected, click on the Vertical Reflect tool
        (<img src = "images/VerticalReflectTool.gif" alt = "Vertical Reflect tool" width = "26" >)
        to make a mirror image of the object. Drag it off to the side where you will continue to manipulate it.<br>

        </li>
        <li>With the reflected orange slice still selected, move it down below the logo, &lt;Ctrl&gt;-dragging it
        to constrain the move vertically downward. Then &lt;Ctrl&gt;-drag a handle on the bounding box to enlarge
        the orange slice (as shown in the illustration below).<br>

<h2>Changing the Perspective</h2>
<p>Now you'll use the Perspective tool to change the perspective of the orange slice.
</p>
<aside>
<h3>The Perspective Tool</h3>
<p>The Perspective tool distorts a path or paths that have been grouped so that an object's original bounding box
is mapped to the edges of a quadrilateral (square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, etc.) and a perspective
operation is applied to the path.</p>
To use this function,
    <ol>
        <li>create the envelope box that will govern how the object will be distorted. Use the Line tool
        (<img src = "images/LineTool.gif" alt = "Line tool icon" width = "26" >), the
        Bezier pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Bezier pen tool icon" width = "26">), or the Rectangle tool (<img src = "images/RectangleTool.gif" alt = "Rectangle tool"
        width = "26">). Make sure that the first corner created is the lower left
        corner of the quadrilateral.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Then, convert the envelope box and the object or objects to paths.  Use the Path &gt; Object to Path
and Path &gt; Stroke to Path functions.<br><br>

If you used the Rectangle tool and converted it to a path with Path &gt; Object to Path, you will most likely have
to rotate the quadrilateral 90&deg; anticlockwise to position the first corner node from the upper left
to the lower left corner. This is an idiosyncratic feature of the Perspective tool we have to work with.<br><br>

To check for proper orientation, make the Edit nodes tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif"
alt = "Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width = "26">) active and press the &lt;Tab&gt; key. The lower
left node of the rectangle should become highlighted, indicating that the rectangle is oriented corrected. If another node is highlighted instead, then rotate the rectangle until the highlighted node is the lower left corner.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Select the objects to be transformed, then select the quadrilateral,
        &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking with the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">).<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Choose Extensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Perspective.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you forget to convert the distortion envelope into a path or any of the objects, the Perspective tool will stop and give you a warning message that one or both objects weren't converted.</p>
    <p>One way to check whether an object was or wasn't converted is to choose the Edit nodes tool (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width = "26">).
    All path nodes show up when this tool is selected. You can determine whether any object hasn't been converted
    by the shape and color of its path nodes.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, the Perspective tool doesn't perform the way you want it to. To troubleshoot, experiment with
    different techniques, such as grouping all the path objects you want to transform, and then using the
    Perspective tool. If items are already grouped and you still receive a warning message, ungroup them and
    then regroup them again &ndash; this technique works in various cases. Outline view (choose View &gt;
    Display mode &gt; Outline) can be used to identify ghost outlines from objects with fills and strokes
    set to <i>None</i>. Delete them. They can produce unexpected results that show up in the transformed object.
    <p><b>Remember:</b> the Perspective tool works only with paths.</p>
</aside>
<ol>
    <li>Make a trapezoid. It will be the perspective envelope that distorts the orange slice object.<br><br>
    Making an envelope that the Perspective function can use is an idiosyncratic task. Use the Line tool
    (<img src = "images/LineTool.gif" alt = "Line tool icon" width = "26" >) or the Bezier
    Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif" alt = "Bezier pen tool icon" width = "26">)
    to draw the shape.<br><br>

		<aside><b>Important:</b> Start drawing the trapezoid from the lower left corner. Then continue to make edges in a clockwise direction. You are creating an ordered sequence of corner points that the
    Inkscape Perspective function understands and can work with.
		</aside>
		<br><br>

    To check if the lower left corner is the first made corner, click on the trapezoid with the Edit Nodes tool
    (<img src = "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit Paths by Nodes tool" width = "26">).
    Then, press &lt;Tab&gt;. If the first corner is highlighted, then the envelope box is correctly oriented.
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/DrawTrapezoid.gif"
        alt = "Draw the template trapezoid"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Draw the template trapezoid.</figcaption>

        alt = "Checking corner number one"
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Testing for Corner No. 1 at lower left corner of trapezoid.
        The first corner is highlighted.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Select the orange slice image, then &lt;Shift&gt;-select the trapezoid to group-select it.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectRectangleTrapezoid.gif"

    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>With the trapezoid and orange slice selected, choose Extensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Perspective.<br><br>
    The Perspective function takes a number of seconds to do its number-crunching. The original shape disappears
    and then reappears as a distortion of itself in the trapezoid.<br>

alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) and press the &lt;Delete&gt; key to delete it.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the distorted orange slice with the Select tool and fine-adjust its shape and position as
    you desire. You can resize it, shear it, and rotate it to suite your taste in the design.

<h2>Further Using the Perspective Tool</h2>
<p>The Perspective tool is a multipurpose tool that, besides letting you change the perspective of an object,
combines the functions of scaling, shearing, reflecting, and rotating.</p>

<p>Now you'll use the Perspective tool to transform objects that you copy from the logo into a business card.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial07/Tutorial07BusinessCard.svg"><b>Tutorial07BusinessCard.svg</b></a> file in the Tutorial07 folder.<br>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Tutorial07BusinessCard file contents.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    You will finish the business card design and then make duplicates of the card to fill up the remaining spaces
    on the artboard.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Choose File &gt; Save As, name the file <b>Buscards.svg</b>, select the Lesson07 folder, and click <b>Save</b>.
    <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Zoom</b> tool (<img src = "images/ZoomInOut.gif" alt = "Zoom In/Out tool icon" width = "26">) in the toolbox and draw a marquee around the image in the upper left corner of the artboard to
    magnify it.<br>

        <figcaption>Ungroup the three individual fruit images.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click off the image to deselect it and then click on the background lime slice in the logo to select it.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/CitrusLogo5.gif"
        alt = "Select the background lime slice."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Select the background lime slice.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
    Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D to make a copy of the object. Note how the copy appears topmost over the over fruit objects.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/CitrusLogo6.gif"
        alt = "Make a copy of the lime slice."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Make a copy of the lime slice.</figcaption>

    <li>
    Position the new lime slice below and slightly to the right of the logo.<br>

        <img src = "images/CitrusLogo7.gif"
        alt = "Move the copy of the lime slice."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Move the copy of the lime slice down and to the right.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Now you'll use the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys in combination with the Select tool to scale the
    new lime slice. Note that using the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys together with the Select tool
    allows you to resize an object from the center of its bounding box and maintain its aspect.<br>
    <figure>
        <img src = "images/CitrusLogo8.gif"
        alt = "Rescale the lime slice so it is larger."
        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Resize the lime slice.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</li>
    <li>With the lime slice still selected, hold down both the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Shift&gt; keys
    and drag the bottom right corner handle down to scale the object from its center and make the lime slice bigger.
    <br><br>
    You will now distort the lime slice using the Perspective tool.<br><br>

    You need to prepare the lime slice object for the Perspective function before you apply it. You will ungroup
    the component parts of the image, eliminate the color gradient (the Perspective tool does not work with gradients
    at this point in time, only solid colors), convert the individual objects into paths, and then distort.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>With the lime slice image still selected (reselect it if it is deselected), use the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-G
    hot key combination to ungroup the component parts that make up the slice.<br>

    <li>Select one of the lime sections in the image. Bring up the Color palette, click on the <b>Fill</b> tab if it isn't
    active already, and click on the <b>Flat color</b> icon. The gradient is now a solid color. The Perspective function
    can work with the image more effectively now.<br>

        class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Eliminate the gradient.</figcaption>

    </li>
    <li>You will now make a shape consisting of the rib "spokes" and the white inner circle. Start by selecting only
    the individual ribs using &lt;Shift&gt;-Select tool and color them red. Red is a good color to work with here
    because the spokes can get lost against any white background. Red prevents that from happening.<br>

    <li>Because the image originally had a gradient in its make-up, there might be a remnant figure
    left behind when you replaced the gradient with a solid color. An artefact like this can produce
    unexpected and undesired side-effects in the distortion process. To find out, choose View &gt;
    Display mode &gt; Outline. If you see a figure like the one below, select the inner spurious circle
    while you're still in Outline mode and press the &lt;Delete&gt; button on the keyboard.<br>

    <li>Choose View &gt; Normal to return to normal view. Draw a bounding box around the lime slice object and
    choose Path &gt; Object to Path convert the box into a path. Here, the bounding box is colored lime green,
    which was the last color used from the Color palette. Group the converted box (now a path) and the
    lime slice object using the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-G hot key combination.<br>

    <li>If you haven't done so already, draw a distortion bounding box starting from the lower left corner of

    width = "26" >) or the Bezier Pen tool (<img src = "images/PenTool.gif"
    alt = "Bezier pen tool icon" width = "26">). If you use the the Rectangle tool, you'll need
    to rotate the rectangle or square anticlockwise by 90&deg; so the initial corner (consider it as Corner #1)
    is the bottom left corner. Test to see if this is the case by choosing the <b>Edit nodes</b> tool (<img src =
    "images/EditPathsByNodesTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" >) while the box is
    still highlighted and pressing the &lt;Tab&gt; key. If the lower left corner is highlighted, then the

    <li>At long last, you will distort the slice of lime. Select the lime slice plus box (it is grouped now, so it
    is all one object) and &lt;Shift&gt;-select the trapezoid. Choose Extensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Perspective.
    The Perspective function will chug away for several seconds and the 'Perspective working' diagnostic box will

<section>
<h2>Review Answers</h2>
<ol>
    <li>There are two ways you can resize an object:
        <ul>
            <li>You can select an object with the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
            alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">) and drag a directional handle. To rescale
            an object proportionately as you change its size, hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key as you drag the
            directional handle.
            </li>
            <li>You can resize an object using the <b>Scale</b> option in the <b>Transform</b> palette. You can
            enter its exact height, width, unit of measurement (inch, percent, millimeter, centimeter, pixel,
            pica), and resize individual objects separately. The object is resized relative to the center of its
            bounding box.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <b>Transform</b> palette allows you to make the following transformations:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Move:</b> by moving or strategically placing objects in your artwork
            (by specifying the x and y coordinates and the point of origin).
            </li>
            <li><b>Scale:</b> by specifying the width and height of selected objects, and whether
            proportionally or not.
            </li>
            <li><b>Rotate:</b> by specifying the angle of rotation clockwise or anticlockwise.
            </li>
            <li><b>Skew:</b> by specifying the amount of vertical and/or horizontal shear in a unit of
            measurement of your choice.
            </li>
            <li><b>Matrix:</b> by editing the entries in a transformation matrix that controls the
            amount of translation, scaling, rotation, and skewing, all in one operation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You can copy an Inkscape object by:
        <ol type = "a">
            <li>selecting it in the source file with the Select tool <img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
            alt = "Selection tool" width = "26">), and then choosing Edit &gt; Copy
            or pressing the hot key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-C (<b>C</b> for <b>C</b>opy) to make a duplicate,
            </li>
            <li>making the destination file active by bring up its Inkscape window, and
            </li>
            <li>choosing Edit &gt; Paste or pressing the hot key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V to paste the
            object into its new home.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
